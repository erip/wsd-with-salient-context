Perhaps , in this instance , it will be the German Presidency of the Council that will send out the signal that moves the European Union further ahead , but I have to say that I would like to see Finland and Portugal acting as particle accelerators , for Germany , although large , is sluggish ; it is comparable with France in being a country with great traditions , but not much in the way of speed .
However , when Mr Metten , by the back door - and that is what this is - recycles a balance of payment facility into some kind of a stability pact accelerator / decelerator model to deal with cycles in the economy , I have a problem .
There , huge machines called particle accelerators are helping physicists in a field of research that has long intrigued man : the secrets of matter and the laws governing the universe .
A study of these two types of particles ( bricks and cement , players and balls ) requires the use of accelerators .
Without accelerators , modern physicists would be as helpless as botanists without magnifying glasses or astronomers without telescopes .
Facilities grouping several interconnected accelerators are located at CERN ( European Laboratory for Particle Physics ) , spanning the Franco - Swiss border .
I ’ m just one of the billions of protons accompanying you on your journey in the SPS ( Super Proton Synchroton ) , CERN ’ s largest accelerator at present .
So the SPS is not an accelerator in the literal sense of the term but is more like a sling whirled around at a constant speed but whose stones get heavier as they move .
The entire ring , nearly seven kilometers ( 4.3 mi ) in circumference , is housed in an underground tunnel several meters wide , where technicians can move around on bicycles when the accelerator is not in operation .
It will now take us just over half a second to leave the accelerator in bundles of ten thousand billion .
Like most of the particles generated in these accelerators , these bosons do not live long — less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second — before they dissolve into energy or transform into other particles .
True , apart from a few small accelerators used in hospitals to produce particles for destroying cancerous cells or as radioactive tracers , the technical spinoffs seem limited .
So no doubt they will continue peering into the world of the infinitesimal , paradoxically by means of ever - larger giant accelerators .
Matter , Yes , But in Minute Quantities : Energy - voracious accelerators do not produce much matter .
If you put particles in them , and they go shooting out the tip -- they &apos; re like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns .
And we keep doing that , and build more powerful machines , accelerators for particles .
The Large Hadron Collider , a particle physics accelerator , that we &apos; ll be turning on later this year .
This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting .
And locally there you could build particle accelerators , and learn elementary particle physics , and chemistry , and so on .
But in the interim this should not be used as a reason for taking our foot off the accelerator on this important issue .
In our opinion this is not a coherent policy , as it effectively consists of stepping on the accelerator and the brake at the same time .
I am quite sure that by taking its foot off the accelerator , the Luxembourg Presidency has steered the EU round a dangerous bend as far as this issue is concerned .
The ALDE Group is anxious to press the accelerator on defence .
It could also give information on any technical changes to a car which are required in order that the holder of the licence may drive , for example reconstruction of the gear box , clutch , brakes or accelerator , an adapted control unit or other restrictions which a vehicle may have .
Following the informal summit in Pörtschach , a good many observers commented - rightly , in my view - that they had the feeling that the Council had been stepping on the brake pedal rather than the accelerator as regards enlargement .
Because of a small , reliable spring that returns the accelerator pedal to its neutral position when you release foot pressure .
Meanwhile , the next time you put your foot on the accelerator pedal of your car , be thankful for the little spring that returns the pedal to its place and allows you to drive safely to your destination .
The accelerator was a hand - operated lever from an early Model T Ford , and the brake was also operated by a hand lever .
From this same unit , a cable is anchored to the accelerator .
It works similarly , with forward movement for braking , but with a downward push for acceleration so that the mere weight of the hand activates the accelerator .
Just as the accelerator controls the speed of a car ’ s engine , thyroid hormones regulate the rate of the body ’ s metabolism — chemical activity in cells that produces energy and new tissue .
Just as the accelerator controls the speed of a car ’ s engine , thyroid hormones regulate the rate of the body ’ s metabolism
As Jared Diamond and others have shown us , this is how civilizations commit suicide , by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes .
We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State .
In many African countries , women are not allowed to own any possessions or open a bank account without the permission of a man .
For this reason we need uniform regulations and we must realise that there will be particular fears if electronic money is issued not just against cash holdings or similar bank account holdings , but if e-money is given on credit .
We found out at the last meeting of our ACP / EU assembly in Abuja that in Nigeria , for example , which has restored democracy , one of the last dictators diverted several billion euros to private accounts .
We should remember that in the Parliament of a Member State there was also a great argument between one of the candidates for the presidency and his opponent , and current President , in which the candidate , Mr Borrell , rightly condemned widespread use of the criterion of income which , since it had not been duly corrected , in reality amounted to a concealment of the deficit in the public accounts .
Therefore , I consider that the Commission proposal regarding the treatment of taxes and social contributions in the accounts is both the most correct one and , from every point of view , is effective in view of the possibility that it can be applied immediately .
Most members of the public do not have a euro account and rarely carry out financial transactions in euros .
In order to eradicate financial crime , we need to start by abolishing banking secrecy and business secrecy and grant any civil group the right to inspect the accounts of companies and their owners and shareholders .
On the other hand , irresponsible rascals would remain in the market and they would look after the consumer only until the clink of money is heard in the seller &apos; s bank account , and no longer .
Instead of simply showing expenses distributed among accounts , the new - format Budget shows more clearly what we are getting for our money .
I am thinking of insolvent consumers or consumers with no bank accounts .
Following the introduction of the quasi euro , everyone has noticed that withdrawing money from their bank accounts becomes more expensive when they cross the border .
A solution needs to be found here , and I would like to ask you , Mrs Schreyer , if a correction of the 1999 accounts could be envisaged .
If it affects Internet banking , as they suggest , then there must be other ways that they can verify the credentials of people who are applying for accounts .
Within the euro zone it is not surprising that constraints have been imposed on public spending decisions because if you have , to all intents and purposes , a joint bank account you are affected by the spending decisions of others and you can expect to want some control over those spending decisions .
According to one newspaper article , the US administration has frozen Albanian accounts which were funding the KLA .
With enlargement the new countries joining have made significant efforts to put their accounts and balances of payments in order .
That accounts for more than 70 percent of employment , 50 percent of investment and 60 percent of the Union &apos; s wealth .
Far too many people have too many financial interests in this matter . There are too many people who do not wish to reveal what is in their hidden accounts .
There is now an aspect that should also be given due consideration : the massaging of budget balance data so as not to reveal any anomalies that may still persist in certain public accounts .
A financial service , whether a savings vehicle like a pension or a mutual fund or just a simple bank account , is by its nature ethereal and intangible .
The Court of Auditors has confirmed the regularity of the accounts , in other words , that the books are in good order , and also of the revenue side of the Budget .
Perhaps ‘ naked marriage ’ is common in Western countries , as couples in love will not care too much about having no flat , car or a big fat bank account .
Meanwhile , @ RescueJacmel , a new Twitter account , is attempting to ensure that international rescue efforts do not overlook the small city .
Blackout for Hungary promoted their start - up on Twitter under the hashtag # blackout4hungary and on a Twitter account as well .
Many parties and political leaders have launched their own Facebook pages and Twitter accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; The Whole &quot; &quot; of the public accounts ( summarized in a table published on the blog Blasfémias ) and the measures taken to cover it , can displease an increasingly broader slice of citizens . &quot;
The information office in Gansu province , where Lanzhou is the capital city , posted this message on its official account on Twitter - like Sina Weibo :
The Beijing news offered this update on its official Weibo account :
Other metrics that offer a clearer indication about technology literacy , such as the ownership of an email account , the frequency of use of email , the access to tools such as Google to search for information , the ability to attach media ( images , video , music ) to electronic messages , the utilization of VoIP such as Skype can all be used as questions to quantify someone ’ s technology literacy .
But will Twitter block those accounts in a more effective way ?
The average person doesn ’ t know the responsibility he assumes when he opens an account .
This principle is based on the assumption that a letter invites a reply , thus balancing the accounts of total mail .
And since most money transactions are made in checks rather than in cash , huge amounts of paper money are in this way “ created ” in checking accounts .
The computer registers the number on the key , which corresponds with the number of the account at the City Clearance Bank .
Of course , credit cards and charge accounts are a great convenience .
For example , a wife learns that her husband put money in the bank in his name rather than in a joint account .
A local branch may have terminal access to a computer that holds the details of a person ’ s account .
If the banking and retail networks were connected together , a person could make purchases and his bank account could be checked and debited without his needing to use cash or credit cards .
“ Do you want a bank account bursting at the seams with money ?
My home was filled with fans and reporters , my evenings with social life , and money was flowing into my bank account .
If your standing with a bank is good , in some places you can borrow money for credit purchases by drawing from your account more than you have , with the bank ’ s approval , of course .
Rather than giving the borrower $ 10,000 in hard cash , the money is usually credited to his bank account for him to draw upon gradually .
Checking accounts often let you write checks for more money than is actually deposited .
The moral account of today ’ s world is completely drained and ready for total foreclosure .
When Jehovah and his Son Jesus Christ soon foreclose on this world ’ s immoral system , the account of the righteous will show a credit balance .
The borrower , whether he spends the money or deposits it in another bank account , will create $ 92 in new deposits .
So it is good to check if accounts are insured and by whom .
He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family .
That &apos; s the image : African countries . But let me say this : if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London -- if the other people who had taken money , estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries &apos; monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they &apos; re able to do this , what is that ? Is that not corruption ?
In those days nobody had bank accounts , or American Express cards , or hedge funds .
Now we &apos; re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
Just that little bit of money , which to me , I wish it was in my bank account -- it &apos; s not , but ...
Adewale Taiwo , aka FeddyBB -- master bank account cracker from Abuja in Nigeria .
Probably , Mr. Teszler had gotten some money into Swiss bank accounts because he managed to take his family first to Great Britain , then to Long Island and then to the center of the textile industry in the American South .
I &apos; ll make a Facebook account . Can you print fliers for the neighborhoods ?
The 50 percent that goes in their house account , every six months , goes to the bank .
So be careful with that Facebook account -- your momma told you , be careful .
Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos; s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos; s bank accounts .
Well there &apos; s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states .
And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure , they wouldn &apos;t necessarily be considered viable customers , because they &apos; re not wealthy enough to have bank accounts .
Now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person &apos; s account .
If your bank account &apos; s one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you open a separate account ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Separate your bank account -- spend your money ; spend his money . That &apos; s it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
There is no excuse for lagging behind in this area , even if we take the factor of each Member State &apos; s national interest into account as well as the almost purely economic nature of the history of the Community &apos; s institutions between the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Maastricht .
The accounts of the Marquis de Sade do not strike me as particularly uplifting , but I do not want to impose a legal ban on them via this report either .
She has given a truly brilliant , nineteenth - century , liberal account , which would not look out of place as an annexe to Dickens &apos; Christmas Carol .
We are focusing our traffic monitoring efforts mainly on ships which carry a higher risk on account of their cargo and their past history .
Mr President , we have today well - documented accounts , attested by experts , of the Gulf War and of the events that led up to it , which show that this war was preceded , or accompanied , by a massive campaign of disinformation .
Secondly , if we want to better protect the territory of the Union against floods - and this is undoubtedly the desire of the European Parliament - we must take into account river basins , which ignore borders mapped out by history .
On the one hand , the enlargement of the European Union and of NATO means that bridges have to be built to Russia , that important country , but Europe &apos; s history means that the European Union must also show itself to be the protector of small countries and that , in any arrangements reached in connection with the Kaliningrad question , the status and sovereignty of small countries must be taken into account if we want to become a credible Union .
In the long term , a monetary union which is not consolidated by an economic union and a political union is not viable ; history has taught us this and we must take it very much into account in order to move forward .
If , in the future , we were to attempt to build a Union without taking into account our history , that would be tantamount to building a castle with no foundations .
Mr President , if I had entered Parliament this year , or better still this month and had heard the Commissioner &apos; s account , I should probably have been mightily impressed .
They were either the quickest prepared set of accounts in history or something magical happened .
However , the debate has a much greater scope as a result of the aspirations of the European Commission , which has wished to impose , without taking account of the will of the Member States and the European Parliament , an in - depth reform of the common agricultural policy , perhaps the greatest in its history .
I am giving this account of American indignation to press home to the Commissioner that he should not be fixated on striking a compromise between us and Minister Rich and company in the current negotiations with the United States , because the playing field is much wider and it is up to us to make it wider still .
For historic reasons , our rail networks are extremely complex . Effective change must take account of the human factor .
What may work for the drought in Spain is at a loss to account for the complexity of the most crucial chapter of our European history .
The Commission has done its job ; as has the European Parliament : it has adopted its position by a large majority and , for the first time in its history , showing responsibility and taking account of the economic difficulties faced by certain Member States , it has proposed slightly lower figures than those proposed by the Commission .
The Dresden Manifesto prepared by young students from a large number of European countries also included another demand : it called for the establishment of a common house for European contemporary history that would report objectively on the history of the 20th century and on Europe today and to give a detailed account of the European project .
Finally , I should like to urge all Members in their own countries , to give the full account , rather than populist talk that is based on xenophobia .
But , Prime Minister , you gave us , initially , a moving account of your country and indeed your own history .
( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , taxation history is full of bogus bank accounts , which are even more harmful when such scandals come to light in European countries .
However , this can not be said without remembering that the borders of Russia were fairly arbitrarily drawn by Mr Gorbachev and Mr Yeltsin , at great speed and without taking account of history .
Ukraine is a multi-ethnic and a multi-confessional country and one with a very chequered history , which is something we have to take into account .
Iran has a long and rich history , and a special identity that should be taken into account at a time when concerns are growing about the recent political and social developments in that country .
I do not intend to give another account of the bloodshed in Zaire but will content myself with offering a few thoughts and suggestions .
Now that we come to assess their achievement in this area , we must take into account the tragic history that they have in common .
The erratic course of the Ancona report which is once more before the House , in a more coherent but much weaker version , reveals the disorientation in the minds of politicians which in turn accounts for the disparities between national drugs policies .
You are not prepared to take any account of the fact that China , that great country , that great nation , emerged only 50 years ago from foreign wars , from a status of prolonged colonialism , from civil wars , and within 50 years it is striving to create its own model , one which matches its history , it s culture , which goes back 5 000 years before our debate today .
I therefore feel that , when passing judgment , we must take account of each country &apos; s history right from its beginnings , rather than simply noting the situation at the specific time when we make these judgments .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Berlin Agenda 2000 package , which accounts for a volume of more than EUR 680 billion , probably contains the most comprehensive reform of EU policies in the history of the Union .
We &apos; ve got memory but not history , we have memories and accounts , but we ignore the thread of the story that unites and integrates .
You can read other interesting stories on his personal blog or in his Twitter account .
But if it were not for the portion of the tentacle that lay in the bottom of the boat , it is doubtful that the other fishermen at Conception Bay would have believed their terrifying account .
So widespread an account is not likely to have been coincidental .
This true - life account of one American businessman raises the question for you : Does your job own you ?
The names in this true - life account of an American businessman have been changed .
Can this account for all the horrors inflicted upon mankind throughout history , and especially in our time ?
For one to assign each section to a different writer on the basis of the different appellations for God would split up the account into meaningless fragments .
For example , The Interpreter ’ s Dictionary of the Bible ( Vol . 3 , p . 713 ) states : “ There are two accounts of what happened , which have been blended into confusion .
David found the account believable , not farfetched , for at the story ’ s conclusion he said in heated anger : “ As Jehovah is living , the man doing this deserves to die !
The absorbing account of a young couple who survived one of history ’ s worst sea disasters
The earliest account of Japanese gardens is found in the Nihon - shoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) written in the eighth century C.E.
Today some of the more ancient accounts have been discovered .
The oldest known non - Biblical Flood account is found in a Sumerian narration .
See also the eyewitness account of Flavius Josephus in Wars of the Jews .
The story of lighthouses includes accounts of remarkable courage and dedication , often on the part of women .
For example , you can trace the heroic account of Helene Gotthold , from Dortmund , Germany .
If evolution were true , then the Bible ’ s account of the creation of the first man , Adam , would be , at best , a story meant to teach a moral lesson but not intended to be taken literally .
When the Bible touches on history , health , and science , it s accounts have repeatedly been proved reliable .
There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon , but since my sister is not here with us today , let me tell you the true story -- -- which is my sister &apos; s a little bit on the clumsy side .
The following objectives were set : improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative ; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector ; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas .
Furthermore , in order to encourage the free movement of workers , we felt it essential to quickly improve the transferability and the acquisition of pension rights from supplementary schemes from different European countries .

The fourth point refers to the transfer from analogue TV to digital TV and its consequences for users in terms of the use and acquisition of new terminals .
I should therefore like to address a matter which has still not been mentioned in this House , namely the acquisition of media - related skills .
The obligation of public and private television broadcasters to allocate a proportion of their annual net income to investment in production and to the acquisition of European audiovisual programmes , including films , works aimed at minorities and ones made by independent producers , must be included in this piece of legislation .
Although , today , there is no alternative to scientific progress and to the increase in knowledge and information , the truth of the matter is that lifelong learning can not be reduced simply to the acquisition of useful skills . It must be part of a culture , of a set of values that provide meaning for mankind &apos; s life in society .
I should like to ask you also to support our making the necessary adjustments to budget line A - 206 , Acquisition of immovable property , depending on which amendments are adopted , so that we do not exceed our self - imposed ceiling of 20 % of total administrative expenditure .
For that reason , we should endorse the call for the responsible authorities at national , regional and local levels to ensure , by their own efforts and with the aid of all available EU support mechanisms , that the same terms and conditions are created throughout the EU for the acquisition of modern information technology by educational establishments .
Despite the fact that the acquisition and loss of nationality is the sole responsibility of the Member States , in view of the fact that the Greek Government is seeking the deletion of references to nationality from identity papers contrary to directives 68 / 360 / EEC and 73 / 148 / EEC which specifically require the nationality to be indicated :
Has information been gathered with regard to naturalisation processes in Greece and other Member States and should the approximation of legislation regarding the acquisition of nationality in the EU Member States be considered ?
The acquisition or loss of citizenship in a Member State is the responsibility of the Member States themselves .
I can also inform you that the Council has not requested information concerning the naturalisation process in Greece and that neither has the Council the authorisation to adopt a position regarding possible approximation of legislation regarding the acquisition of nationality in the EU Member States .
Finally , acquisition and possession of child pornography with the aim of handing it over to the law enforcement authorities should be made an offence .
I am thinking of the Benes decrees and of the acquisition of land in Poland , for example .
While it is acceptable to mention acquisition of knowledge of the host language as being fundamental to social integration , it goes too far to insist that this is a criterion for granting of EC residence status .
It is a pity that her more progressive ideas narrowly missed endorsement in the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs and we now have before us a more begrudging approach to long - term residents from third countries , with an overemphasis on terrorism , language acquisition and sufficient resources , especially in the area of pensions .
This report was presented in Stockholm and we are currently preparing a programme of work on the subject of the universal acquisition of basic skills , which will be presented in Barcelona .
The acquisition of basic skills is one of the 13 basic objectives for the education and training systems of the European Union .
As you know , the bottom line in the national actions plans of most countries is that there is a direct link between social exclusion and the acquisition of basic skills .
The amendment of the status of legal persons does not solve the problem of the legal obstacles to the right of association or to the law on foundations , recently ratified by the Supreme Court , prohibiting the acquisition of property by foundations run by non-Muslim religious minorities in Turkey .
In Wales , my own nation , and indeed the whole of the UK , there is a problem in encouraging the acquisition of language skills across the board .
With regard to the acquisition of quotas from the buyback programme , however , the other tobacco farmers who wish to purchase the quotas have priority .
Amongst the concrete measures envisaged we also incorporate the harmonisation of operative requirements , the common use of capabilities , the possible acquisition of those capabilities via a European arms agency , which unifies or at least coordinates the existing ones , the study of an accounting system more suited to reality , which facilitates the long - term funding of certain systems and also the search - as I said before - for new common funding formulas .
The multiannual Konver programme , which ran from 1994 to 1999 , financed measures such as the acquisition of new civil qualifications by staff , the diversification of the economic structure of companies , aid for the development of small and medium - sized enterprises , the reallocation of military sites to new civil sectors and the rehabilitation of the environment .
The concept of lifelong learning will then help with adaptation to technological change and with the acquisition of new knowledge .
Possible acquisition by Arcelor of certain factories in Poland or other third countries would be the subject of a survey by the Commission , pursuant to Regulation 4064 / 89 on the control of concentrations between undertakings .
Mr President , aid which is conditional on the acquisition of goods or services originating in the donor country has repeatedly been condemned as an immoral and inefficient practice by recipient countries and the worst - affected NGOs on the one hand , and on the other by the majority of agencies involved in development issues . Among the latter are many intergovernmental organisations .
Indeed , it appears extremely appropriate to consider taxing the use of vehicles rather than their acquisition , and the Commission is , therefore , right to propose abolishing the vehicle registration tax and establishing or increasing taxes on circulation , fuel and the use of some road infrastructures .
The exploitation of natural resources has become unsustainable , with the developed industrialised nations dominating the acquisition of resources .
The problem lies in access to Community funding for control activities requiring the acquisition of ‘ heavy equipment ’ , which the Commission did not wish to consider in its proposal , intending instead to restrict access to the available funds just to the new Member States .
Secondly , it creates credibility through the certification and recognition of occupational and extra-vocational experience , including voluntary work in the realms of social welfare , culture and sport as well as the acquisition of various linguistic skills .
The danger represented by nuclear arms being acquired by pariah states not committed to international law and by terrorist groups can not be compared with the acquisition of such arms by states which form part of the fabric of modern international relations , and it would not be reasonable to act as if the two were comparable .
On this point , I believe that it is particularly important for the procedures to be applied for which provision is made for activities relating to genetically modified organisms under the Carthage Protocol , for example , and for the acquisition and exchange of experience to be promoted .
Timely decisions on planned network routes would reduce unnecessary costs incurred as a result of land acquisitions .
In November 2005 , the Russian state - owned pipeline company Transneft terminated the long - term transport agreement with the Kazakhstan company KazMunaiGaz , as it is now negotiating the acquisition of the shares of a Lithuanian oil refinery and a long - term contract for oil transit , which appears in contradiction with Russia ’ s expansionist plans .
Beyond this issue , I believe that the rapporteur ’ s proposals with regard to the acquisition of citizenship of one or another Member State and to the discrimination against third - country nationals residing in a given Member State should be taken up by this plenary assembly , with all the political groups joining together .
I would further say that , given that citizenship of the Union has undoubtedly developed into a source of real , specific rights , it must depend on clear and specific rules for its acquisition .
The European Parliament is calling on the Member States to consider establishing a closer link between permanent legal residence over a reasonable period of time and the acquisition of national – and hence European – citizenship .
It is underlining its desire for greater coordination of the general criteria and procedures for the acquisition of nationality in the Member States .
Of course , there may be arguments in favour of reforming the rules concerning the acquisition of national citizenship following a fairly long period of continuous residence in a country and concerning the opportunity to vote and eligibility to be a candidate in local , regional and national elections .
It is therefore easy to understand why Brussels is trying to simplify and relax the rules for entering and residing in European territory because it is on them that the acquisition of this new citizenship depends .
I believe that recent events give the Commission special authorisation to implement the legislation that has been passed , to implement decisions for the acquisition of alternative , energy - efficient resources and the creation of a truly liberalised energy market , and to secure the integration of European energy networks .
The acquisition of and , by that token , also of another Polish bank , , is therefore a clear breach of the privatisation agreement .
I must underline that the end result was that certain individual Member States gave assistance to the tsunami- affected countries by providing funds for the acquisition of vessels which have been purchased without any control measures .
A major question facing development countries is the illicit acquisition of public funds by government officials who store them in offshore accounts .
– Mr President , there is , of course , in our interconnected world , no alternative to the acquisition of new knowledge or to the mastering of more than one language .
This budgetary approach translates into more effective , transparent and analytical estimates , which leads me to another key issue in the report : the acquisition of parliamentary buildings .
Nevertheless , it would be prudent to consider re-examining the overall acquisition policy of Parliament ’ s buildings , including the information offices in the various Member States .
I also believe that there should be more concrete measures for dealing with the possession of weapons and acquisition and , in any event , that is an issue that I would like us to discuss .
The promotion of technological research and the acquisition of scientific knowledge are the major challenge facing Europe in the 21st century .
It is also far from certain that the acquisition by a single operator of all live Premier League rights would have led to lower costs for English football fans .
– Mr President , I abstained on the Trüpel report , because the acquisition of so - called key competences presupposes basic skills such as reading , writing , arithmetic and logical , critical thinking .
This situation will be difficult to manage when , in a few years &apos; time , the property - acquisition process will start to decline .
It is useful to think in terms of an operational budget , but it is necessary to be very attentive and very much on the ball if , as proposed by the Grech report , we wish , as the need arises , to mobilise more money in order to acquire buildings , given that acquisition procedures are extremely protracted , what with the Bureau being required to give a decision , the Committee on Budgets needing to offer an opinion and the Council having to give us the go - ahead .
Prudential assessment of acquisitions and increase of shareholdings ( debate )
The next item is the report by Wolf Klinz , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92 / 49 / EEC and Directives 2002 / 83 / EC , 2004 / 39 / EC , 2005 / 68 / EC and 2006 / 48 / EC as regards procedural rules and evaluation criteria for the prudential assessment of acquisitions and increase of shareholdings in the financial sector C6-0298 / 2006 .
At the same time , however , we should not overlook problems in the EU , where organisations from some Member States have faced problems relating to the acquisition of firms in other Member States .

( ES ) Mr President , cross -border issues and the acquisition of shares in banks , insurance and investment companies are less than in other sectors .
Of Croatia &apos; s outstanding commitments arising from the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , the Council has highlighted state aid and the acquisition of property .
It is important in this respect to maintain the balance between employers and employees on which the acquisition of pension rights depends .
With regard to these two aspects , we are opposed to the amendments tabled in the report amending the Commission &apos; s original proposal . These amendments propose , for example , to increase from 21 to 25 the age of access to supplementary pension schemes and to make the acquisition of pension rights conditional on a minimum five - year period .
Lastly , we are very disappointed at the rejection of the amendments we tabled , including the proposal to combine the Commission &apos; s original position on the minimum age of 21 with a two - year period of acquisition of rights , which would have been more favourable to the workers .
The new directive and Mrs Ria Oomen - Ruijten &apos; s report both aim to improve the mobility of workers , within and between the Member States of the European Union , by establishing minimum requirements concerning the acquisition and retention of supplementary pension rights .
According to information from the German Federal Government in the summer of 2006 , the EU is acquiring certain communications facilities from NATO ( with costs shared between the two organisations ) for the purpose of implementing operation Althea , is negotiating the acquisition of the cartographic material for Bosnia and Herzegovina originally produced for NATO or is renting a precisely defined infrastructure ( container ) at the shared headquarters Camp Butmir , albeit already in the form of a regular contractual agreement that goes beyond Berlin Plus .
Control of the acquisition and possession of weapons ( debate )
We were therefore obliged to include specific articles to cover the illegal use , trade and acquisition of firearms .
I voted in favour of the report by Doris Pack on &apos; Adult learning : it is never too late to learn &apos; , because I consider that adult learning , through the acquisition of essential skills , is crucial for achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy of greater economic growth , competitiveness and social inclusion .
Member States , together with the European Commission , should find a solution as quickly as possible to the problem of the substantial group of women assisting with farming and in small and medium - sized enterprises who , in many Member States , suffer from a lack of legal status . This leads to financial and legal problems for these women in relation to the right to maternity and sick leave , the acquisition of pension rights and access to social security .
Education , alongside the acquisition of general learning and cultural knowledge , plays a vital role in developing a tolerant European society .
In addition , the acquisition of adapted physical and intellectual tools must receive greater support from the Union , as stated in the report , especially in the area of access to technological innovations .
These projects will allow us to test the working methods used during joint operations and to test relations with third countries for return operations and the acquisition of travel documents .
We understand that technological changes will have major financial implications , and that therefore the regions should also be able to use the structural funds in order to finance the acquisition of advanced technological installations , create jobs in innovative fields and rehabilitate urban areas freed up by the transfer of port facilities .
The acquisition of a diverse range of language skills is of the greatest importance for all EU citizens , since it enables them to derive full economic , social and cultural benefit from freedom of movement within the Union and from the Union &apos; s relations with third countries .
Most of the report concerns treatment , diagnosis , the acquisition of expertise and the creation of centres and networks .
The issue of financing the acquisition of higher skills can not be overlooked , especially in a time of crisis .
My father has come to recognize that our efforts are toward something far more valuable and long lasting than the acquisition of fortune and prestige .
I plunged into research , acquisitions of artifacts , exhibits , tours , lectures , archaeological excavations , and military and historical ceremonies .
The Romans acquired much gold from their conquest of Spain and their acquisition of Spanish gold mines , says one source .
Barbara Lust , professor of linguistics and human development , stated : “ Children as young as 3 years of age already possess a remarkable knowledge of language structure and syntax which is so complex and precise that it must challenge any known learning theory to account for its acquisition . ”
Here again we see the tying in of the spirit of wisdom with the acquisition of accurate knowledge .
So , the emotional and intellectual profits are huge -- the acquisition of leadership , teaching and training principles , the sense of commitment , responsibility , generosity and dedication to others , and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals .
It &apos; s simply to use language around them , because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others , that are important to you , are saying to you .
The Constitution requires rearmament , in that ’ the Member States are obliged to progressively improve their military capacities ’ , a process to be supervised by an ‘ agency in the field of defence capabilities development , research , acquisition and armaments ’ , which will also implement ’ appropriate measures to strengthen the industrial and technological basis of the defence sector ’ .
Volunteering leads to the direct involvement of citizens in local development and plays an important role in the acquisition of skills , and improving the employability of volunteers , enabling them to gain a very wide range of skills and competences .
However , the support measures for the redundant workers include occupational guidance and training for the acquisition of basic skills , on - and off - the - job training for redundant apprentices , vocational educational training , and support for entrepreneurship .
“ It is , therefore , clear that all normal humans bring into the world an innate faculty for language acquisition , language use , and grammar construction ....
However , the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms , particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which , by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions , can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions .
As for Article 7 , which is in fact a Portuguese proposal that I was able to present to the Reflection Group which prepared the previous Intergovernmental Conference , this article establishes a specific mechanism , and this is the point to which the honourable Member &apos; s question refers , for taking action against any Member State which seriously and persistently breaches the principles mentioned in the previous article , Article 6 .
This mechanism goes back to an idea originally put forward in the Spinelli report in 1984 , and it is linked with the need to guard against breaches of democratic principles within a Member State , and in particular against actions that may infringe the principles of the rule of law .
Each country has structures to protect its citizens and undertakings internationally and for this reason there are specific mechanisms which we all use every day in our international action .
These are objective commitments which the governments assumed in signing these conclusions and which involve the reorientation of the mechanisms and structures and action plans and programmes which exist within the European Union .
In parallel with the work on these practical aspects , a discussion is ongoing within the European Union on determining the mechanisms for participation both by EU Member States which are not members of NATO and by NATO countries which are not EU Member States . This discussion is occurring within the overall context of action on the Petersberg tasks specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
This resolution seeks to encourage initiatives and action and ask the Commission to help perhaps with financial mechanisms to support the re-settlement of these people .
We feel sure that actions we have already launched and which are now up and running will enable alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to be put in place shortly and will enable us to provide a rapid response to the challenges of settling disputes arising from e-commerce .
The outcome at COP6 should ensure this by balancing the use of Kyoto mechanisms such as emissions trading with domestic action - supplementarity - and by addressing the need to demonstrate progress on policies for reducing emissions by 2005 .
The key actions included in this decision are : identification of and improved coordination among the key actors to intervene in the case of emergencies ; special training programmes to promote better cooperation and complementarity between the actors concerned ; establishment of efficient communication systems to allow for better and more rapid communications .
&quot; The European Union negotiating position concentrated on safeguarding the environmental integrity of the Kyoto protocol in the areas of land - use change and forestry , the &quot; &quot; sinks &quot; &quot; issue , the relation between the Kyoto mechanism and domestic action , known as &quot; &quot; supplementarity &quot; &quot; , and compliance . &quot;
This mechanism specifically focuses on actions within the context of European programmes .
The mechanism for mutual evaluation by the Member States set forth in the 1997 Amsterdam Joint Action Plan , which - albeit somewhat behind schedule - has become operative , allows us to carry out the first stage .
This evaluation mechanism , which Mr Ferri has just mentioned and which forms the basis of the excellent report that he presented to the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedom and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , was instituted on the basis of the action plan against organised crime approved in Amsterdam in June 1997 .
Until this programme comes into force , we will not have the necessary mechanisms for Community - level coordination and monitoring of the actions that are undertaken . These are fundamental aspects of the global strategy which the Council undertook to adopt .
The four priority types of action under this mechanism are : prevention of accidents , rapid reaction capability , response in emergency situations , and recovery measures in the event of a disaster .
Or the article which favours internal - action policies and measures for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , rather than the use of &apos; flexible mechanisms &apos; ( which the resolution restricts to no more than 50 % ) . Or the article which calls for , beyond current stipulations , for the WTO to comply with environmental priorities established externally by an international conference , in order to prevent countries which do not ratify the Kyoto Protocol from obtaining unfair competition advantages .
It is therefore necessary - and this is what we have understood - the strengthen the fight against terrorism and create mechanisms and initiatives which strengthen cooperation between the Member States , bearing in mind , furthermore , the intensification of terrorist actions within the European Union .
Promoting scientific research into resources and the equal sharing of this knowledge with developing countries , aid for the organisation of local communities that depend on fishing , improving and promoting mechanisms for regional cooperation and support for fighting against flags of convenience and illegal fishing are , therefore , only some of the measures that show that the course of action now being proposed is the right one for us to take together .
If fishermen are willing to take responsible action themselves , when going to sea could risk further stock decimation , there must be some mechanism that allows them to do so without going bankrupt .
Obviously , action to help the victims speaks louder than words of support and we have no choice here but to admit that there is no mechanism at European Union level to provide help in these and similar natural disasters .
The Commission has been calling for this , proposing that a permanent interinstitutional mechanism be created to implement its Action Plan , in order to ensure the quality of legislation .
Much of the work has already been done and all that remains is to enhance certain points so that the mechanism can be put into action .
That is why we want to have a mechanism whereby the Council involves Parliament at an earlier stage , and here we are proposing firstly that Parliament be consulted when possible joint actions are being examined , if necessary on a confidential basis .
This was the underlying objective of the Commission Communication on Network and Information Security , which proposed a number of measures , such as awareness - raising actions and improved exchange of information mechanisms .
These initiatives and the rapporteur have both sought to establish a designated framework for action under the framework decisions , to safeguard the necessary independence of the national authorities when dealing specifically with incidents that have occurred within their territory - whilst at the same time providing for common mechanisms for regulation in order to pursue the shared commitment to combat all forms of organised crime , in line with the conclusions of the Tampere Council .
The aim of this proposal is therefore to strengthen the instruments for combating networks , by establishing a residence permit for the victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings with arrangements that encourage them to cooperate with the competent authorities against the perpetrators of the offences in question , but avoiding any type of abuse in the way this mechanism is used .
The mechanisms for this are clearly inadequate , but does this mean we have to wring our hands and conclude that the objective of joint action is unachievable ?
Commissioner , I should like to know , firstly , your own directorate &apos; s response to this type of action and , secondly , whether there are any other mechanisms , besides going through the Czech authorities , that can be utilised in future to prevent this particular instance and also similar instances which are currently threatened in Poland , Hungary and Slovenia .
How can we , in this matter , put this failure on Europe &apos; s part to good use in order to move the Convention forward , in order to prevent Europe &apos; s weakness being the cause of the next such situation , and how do we acquire capacity for action by means of better mechanisms that enable us to unchain the political will that we share ?
It is time the European Union got its act together and made it clear that we will not stand for the kind of actions that have been taken in relation to Iraq , that we will unite to put in place serious peaceful conflict - prevention mechanisms to achieve what the world needs , that is , stability and peace .
Member States will not be allowed to issue allowances that exceed their previously agreed targets , and they must not use the Kyoto mechanisms to avoid taking action to reduce emissions domestically .
We therefore trust that the Commission - despite the fact that it has expressed some reservations in relation to the report - will stipulate our requirements as soon as possible in this regard and respond to the commitment made with the international community by means of the millennium declaration - to which end the United Nations adopted an agenda for action which involves 1 300 non-governmental organisations - to create a mechanism for permanent consultation with non-state actors and improve open and integrated dialogue , which the rapporteur , Mr Howitt , calls participatory development .
This largely technical report seeks to update and extend the scope of the Joint Action and to improve the exchange of information , risk assessment and control of synthetic drugs and narcotic drugs on the basis of current procedures such as the ‘ early - warning system ’ , the mechanism for assessing the social risks to health , amongst other things – by a scientific committee – and the procedure of monitoring by Member States .
I say this to demonstrate that the very considerable efforts agreed by the Commission and by this Parliament – which you stress yourselves – to reinforce all the mechanisms for action and assessment concerning respect for human rights are determined not only by the international context , but also by the relations that the EU ’ s Member States individually maintain with these different countries .
There are major advantages in coordinated Community action in this area and the Agency can play a crucial role , by integrating mechanisms that will make cleaning - up operations more effective following oil spills ;
These actions plans will set out the agreed priorities of our relationships in key areas , as well as mechanisms to ensure their timely implementation .
. – During the five years in which the area of freedom , security and justice ( AFSJ ) adopted in the Tampere plan of action has been in operation , reactionary laws have been promoted and military and police mechanisms , uncontrolled information services , personal files and prosecutions have increased .
Scepticism and climate change are two phenomena that have become so closely interlinked in the global debate on the future of our planet , that we are in danger of losing sight of the very real steps that have been taken , under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms , towards setting a framework for future action to control the impact of human activities on the earth .
In accordance with the European Employment Strategy , the Member States have put mechanisms in place for meeting this objective as part of their national action plans .
In its declaration , the Luxembourg Government advocated the reinforcement of its institutional mechanisms and the integration of gender into all its actions and policies .
In spite of the Council of Ministers &apos; resolution of November 2004 and the detailed EU action plan for promoting democracy in Belarus , the European Commission insists on using the existing mechanism for support to civil society in Belarus .
If we really want all our mechanisms to be monitored and evaluated , the European Parliament must be involved , and kept informed about , every action decided in accordance with the guidelines and with the structured human rights dialogues and be involved in all the measures taken by the Commission and the Council .
This list , which is awaiting approval , includes in particular the illicit brokering of small arms , control of transfers , verification of end use , the link between security and development , the management of weapons held by the military and security forces , the creation of machinery for implementing the UN action plan , the possession of small arms by civilians , transfer to non-state players and technical assistance for the submission and presentation of reports .
I therefore believe that the proposal you have before you today will close existing loopholes and reinforce our actions to combat terrorism and organised crime .
What we expect from Tunis may be summed up as follows : confirmation of the Geneva declaration on an inclusive information society respecting human rights , freedom of expression and cultural and linguistic diversity ; a summit focused on action and devoting its attention to a limited number of priorities ; an agreement on financing which will result in higher priority being attached to information and communication technology within the existing mechanisms and which incorporates the Digital Solidarity Fund created in Geneva .
That is why I have proposed a mechanism within the plan of action for permanently monitoring the implementation of existing rules , so as to evaluate whether and to what extent we are progressing – and you have endorsed that .
Ultimately , market mechanisms will ration the remaining supplies of oil and provide an incentive for a shift to alternative sources of energy , but appropriate action can be taken in support of that and to promote energy efficiency .
It is an &apos; escort &apos; of the anti-grass roots , reactionary action plan being discussed at the informal summit in England to extend capitalist restructurings within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy , make drastic cuts to social benefits , agricultural production and small and medium - sized enterprises and transfer resources to strengthen the military capitalist mechanisms .
The collection of data and the development of strategies for patient mobility , the further development of the electronic health card , mechanisms for the promotion of organ transplants , cooperation between the Commission and the Member States and with international organisations such as the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , are needed for there to be exchanges of opinions and for the promotion of health actions .
Although it is based on the mechanisms of the current programme , the regulation provides for two new types of action : those relating to motorways of the sea and those relating to traffic avoidance .
Given that Community action should complement that of the national authorities , in terms of prevention , planning and intervention , rehabilitation and follow - up , it is essential to step up coordination at all levels , to improve the existing mechanisms and to develop early warning systems .
I therefore believe that the Economic and Monetary Union needs to be supplemented by a European Social Union , action to establish which could be taken , for example , firstly , by creating the machinery to combat social dumping ; secondly , by laying down minimum social standards across Europe , and , thirdly , by creating European social security systems that make poverty impossible .
The purpose of this proposal is to strengthen the mechanism on the basis of the experience acquired since 2001 , to lay down a legal basis for future Community action in the area of civil protection and to strengthen the rapid response and preparedness instrument for emergencies .
Primarily , however , the establishment of mechanisms to respond to &apos; terrorist action &apos; can not be accepted .
In this regard , I would like to stress that our proposal offers considerable progress in terms of the organisation of mechanisms to guarantee the participation of SMEs in all of the Programme &apos; s actions .
The report that I am presenting to this House calls for action on three levels : more consistency in conducting dialogues and consultations , which will require greater coordination between the Council , whose absence from this debate I regret , the Commission and Parliament , using a mechanism to facilitate smooth communication and avoid contradictions between the various Community institutions .
I call upon the European Commission to review the priorities and mechanisms of the European Social Fund in order to extend the financing of common actions , which would contribute to the social inclusion of the Roma minority .
But we did not restrict ourselves to approving a joint strategy , we also laid down an action plan and a mechanism for implementing the strategy , and we are now setting up an institution between the European Commission and the African Union , the African Union Commission , to enable them to work together to implement what we have agreed .
Secure customs exchange mechanisms will also enable rapid action to be taken when information becomes available on new types of dangerous products .
These points are : No 14 , in which the European Council looks forward to a renewed Social Agenda , No 15 , where it urges Member States to take concrete action , and No 16 , which is very lengthy and wherein certain solutions are proposed and old and well - known mechanisms advocated .
Moreover , in the absence of a serious legal study , I have considerable reservations about the hasty manner in which the report tackles the issue of collective action by consumers against producers by asking the Commission to put forward a comprehensive solution at European level offering all consumers access to collective appeal mechanisms for settling cross-border disputes .
In the long term , we can not manage the agonising mechanism of providing troops for military actions such as Darfur and Chad , as we have done up to this point .
The new directive on waste will force countries that have neglected municipal waste management to take decisive action . These countries will be forced to introduce legal and economic mechanisms in order for their effect to be one that stimulates rather than burdens the economy .
The new Directive on waste will force countries that have neglected municipal waste management to take decisive action . These countries will be forced to introduce legal and economic mechanisms in order for their effect to be one that stimulates rather than burdens the economy .
This unity of Member States should also be seen in the Union &apos; s future actions : - a common energy policy based on the creation of new transportation routes to use different sources than the present ones , the development of a set of Black Sea policies to increase the geostrategic and security importance of the region , as well as the active involvement and promotion of new mechanisms for solving the frozen conflicts in the region .
If we are not capable , today , of asking ourselves questions about the scope of effective mechanisms for applying pressure and for implementing , then I do not really know what kind of situation will justify our finally taking action .
This is why , in my view , the European Union needs to urgently take action to include in future agreements with Russia and Ukraine some comprehensive clauses on energy interdependency , which will set out clear obligations and effective mechanisms for rapidly resolving any problems .
Last but not least , the proper operation of this organisation is important to all of us who want to see an assertive , efficient , multilateral mechanism whose actions promote these values .
There are still many ways in which European action can support the Member States in combating rare diseases , such as by improved identification and recognition of diseases , by supporting research into rare diseases and with mechanisms such as regulation of orphan medicinal products .
This V- FLEX is complementary to actions taken by the World Bank and the IMF , and will target the most vulnerable countries with poor resilience capacity , giving rapid grant assistance to help them to maintain priority spending , notably in the social sectors .
Any action to reduce the effects and adapt to the situation requires a robust mechanism to be in place for measuring , reporting on and verifying developments , along with a properly managed fund comprising public and private finances .
We regret the lack of timely , reliable , comparable data , at both regional and EU level , for the indicators decided on for the follow - up to the Beijing Platform for Action , including women and poverty , violence against women , institutional mechanisms , women and armed conflict and the girl child .
The European Union should not link its foreign policy or policy of solidarity in the event of crisis to military action and militarised structures and mechanisms .
We do not need mechanisms to tackle debt that are excessively automatic and pro-cyclical , which risk failing to meet the objective and , if anything , risk hindering actions to boost economic growth .
In particular , the Heads called for determined action in ensuring the availability of adequate financial support through the European Financial Stability Facility pending the entry into force of the permanent mechanism .
This mechanism ought to be implemented by coordinating actions between Member States and the European Commission , in cooperation with the Hague conference , the Council of Europe and child protection organisations which strive to prevent child trafficking for adoption .
Indeed , I think that the European Union would have gained from publicising these actions and making them much more visible , because people too often have the impression that the Member States alone carry out these operations , whereas you have pointed out that European mechanisms have worked here .
The only part of the action that we usually see is the keyboard , but when the key is struck , it sets into operation a finely balanced mechanism that throws a small , felt - covered hammer at a string .
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition , primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions , also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements , and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges , whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals .
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF , which was set up at the same time as OLAF , to safeguard the independence of OLAF , however it can not undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF .
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen , on his work , to thank the speakers and , of course , to acknowledge the actions of Vice - President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure , who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result .
&quot; By taking action in the field of culture , we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul , especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up &quot; &quot; Culture 2000 &quot; &quot; are superb . &quot;
Our programme highlights the major points of reference , the major areas for action : firstly , the development of new forms of governance for Europe ; secondly , extension and enlargement of the area of peace , freedom , and security ; thirdly , the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy ; fourthly , safeguarding and improving quality of life .
In this context , activity - based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives , actions and resources .
The most important task aid agencies have is to make themselves unnecessary , all the while ensuring that the work is leading to local action and prosperity .
The White Paper on governability , on the one hand , and the difficulties of balancing the budget , on the other , are the two pillars upon which we must base a joint political action for the short term .
We must , of course , be thorough in this , as we are not supposed to be just drawing up general guidelines , and this is related to the third point which you addressed to me on the report on our actions .
In February , we presented an annual report on the actions carried out in 1999 , which we would like to expand .
I only have one additional question , which is whether the Commissioner would submit to us an annual report on the Commission &apos; s actions in this field ?
- The new regulation provides for the Commission to submit an annual report to the Council and to Parliament on its actions the previous year by 30 April of the following year .
As regards the specific question raised by the resolution and related to the situation in the Balkans , the Commission agrees that there is a real danger of massive development of organised crime activities if no coherent and coordinated action is set up in this region associating the various donors as well as the international and regional actors .
The Committee stresses the importance of the collaboration between those non-governmental organisations and associations , whose activities complement the Community action programmes , to achieving the European Union &apos; s aims with regard to equal opportunities between men and women .
The Commission will , in all its actions , respect these principles and we will not fail to act under the obligations of the Treaty if any Community law is breached .
May I point out that the European Patent Office is not a Community body ; its existence and it s actions are derived from an international agreement to which all the Member States of the European Union and four other countries are a party , but not the Community itself .
Therefore , I can not give you authoritative information on the actions of the European Patent Office in this particular case .
Mr Kirkhope &apos; s excellent report makes it very clear how much we still have to do and where we need to improve , in terms of establishing specialist units , strengthening cooperation and exchanges between States , in terms of Europol &apos; s activities and the efficiency of Member States &apos; actions , including , where necessary , the revision of their own legislation and the procedures in force in these areas so that we can guarantee the effective imposition of criminal sanctions .
But even if action was undertaken in each Member State to create specialised units working in liaison , as the report advocates , that would not solve the problem of the networks because their work would still be restricted by national borders .
International cooperation is needed in this area , admittedly , as is Europol action , and why do we not extend Interpol &apos; s mandate ? If child pornography must be fought , however , then it must be fought as such , whatever the means of transmission !
Tomorrow we may take a softer line , but nevertheless we want to see action in this area .
Given that UNMIK and it s head , Bernard Kouchner , do not act of their own accord , but under international supervision in which the Council is also involved , the latter should scrutinise their actions more closely where they affect the interests of European undertakings , if it wishes to avoid raising doubts about its intentions though the answers it gives .
Since the Commission , which is unfortunately taking an unconscionable amount of time to reply , is well aware of the actions of the undertakings concerned , and in order to avoid any doubts about whether the Council is responsible for failing to act , will the latter say to what extent it is prepared to act in accordance with the obligations imposed on it by the Treaties and to support the interests of the undertakings in question ?
Each country is normally obliged to protect the actions of its undertakings within the international sphere .
It is ridiculous that a financial company has to operate while being subject to , and having to have knowledge of , fifteen different legislations , but it is at least as ridiculous that an investor - especially a non-professional investor - should end up needing to contract services , bound by regulations which he or she does not know , from companies whose solvency is unknown , and , in the event of legal dispute , he or she has to take action in a foreign country , with foreign jurisdiction and procedures .
These restrictions on the principle of freedom of action , which were originally intended to be temporary restrictions , have been extended and will be in force until 1 January 2003 as a mechanism to allow certain Member States &apos; fishing industries to adapt to the rules of free competition in an increasingly open and globalised market .
Mr President , this debate confirms the Commission &apos; s opinion that we need to provide for the most comparable and transparent statistics possible , since they are essential for the definition of certain basic lines for our actions , and particularly that we need finance to be clarified with regard to its legal formula .
We must continue to improve the Community &apos; s capacity for external action and further democratise key areas of the Union &apos; s activities .
Having considered all the main issues , the amendment we are presenting today finally raises the Council &apos; s proposal from 3 to 5 million , and this committee , whose members represent the various Member States , will therefore have fewer projects to deal with and will therefore be able to concentrate more on a global view of such an important field of action .
Within this &apos; continuum &apos; I would like to know whether , as has been the case until now , ECHO will be an office dependent on the Commission , but whose action will be based on development policies aimed at what we want to see , and that is the eradication of poverty .
Community action within the context of the Euratom Treaty complies with the provisions of the Treaty and relates , in particular , to the financing of the Commission &apos; s tasks : protection against radiation , monitoring safety and research .
Today we need to extend our action to eradicate discrimination on the labour market , involve women in social dialogue and deal with violence against women .
If shellfish gatherers were to wait for carpetshells to reach this size , mortality would be considerable and such loss would be due to environmental conditions and not to the women &apos; s actions .
Mr President , the Gyllenhammer report on industrial restructuring makes two separate proposals : the first concerns action by companies with over one thousand employees , which can voluntarily draft a basic report at regular intervals on how they intend to restructure , and the second concerns the European Observatory on Industrial Change .
I have never taken any parliamentary action on matters which bear directly on my corporate interests and have refrained from voting on such matters , despite the fact that I am not obliged to do so .
The Member &apos; s question refers to the Council &apos; s actions , firstly with regard to the checks carried out by Member States at external sea borders and secondly the measures which may be taken in the country of origin in order to prevent illegal migration and combat the activities of traffickers .
And quite apart from our own reservations , there is also an independent report , which has just been referred to , which outlines all the limits and shortcomings of this action .
The European Council issued a strong condemnation of this traffic in human beings and the Council renewed its commitment to Europe - wide action against the criminals involved in such activities .
The French Presidency is today proposing to improve the operation of the 11 euro states , shortly to become 12 , by making its work more visible and more authoritative , to enhance the coordination of our budget policies by making the Community inspection procedures more effective , to make progress in the harmonisation of our tax policies in the wake of the European Council at Feira and , finally , to take action to prepare our citizens for the forthcoming advent of the euro .
These actions led to the labeling of the Mexican government as schizophrenic by Amnesty International , since on the international stage Mexico champions for Human Rights , but allows violations to take place in their lands .

We can see he &apos; s been focused in America because he &apos; s been campaigning , probably , but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East .
But a piece of work we did was on : what five positive actions can you do to improve well -being in your life ?
I wonder if we shall begin to be required to have some form of register of addresses in the future .
Mr President , this is one of those areas where those of us who are neither legally nor technically expert address debates of this kind with our fingers crossed behind our backs , hoping that we are getting it right .
In the keynote address Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada said that mankind had entered into an “ era of a community of interest vital to the survival of the species . ”
It &apos; s the sensible shoe of public address .
Unfortunately , some individuals use the Internet to provide details of their base acts and addresses where children can be procured .
So you can rave on forever about the information society , which will resolve every last problem once everyone , from babes in arms to grey - beards , not forgetting illiterates , will have an email address even if they can not afford to pay for the computer equipment to consult it .
( IT ) Madam President , I voted for the Paciotti report , principally because this directive is intended to protect the identities , personal data , first names , surnames , addresses and characteristics of the citizens of the European Union .
I feel , for example , that it is very important for physically abused women to have access to information everywhere on where they can go , where they can find suitable accommodation and stay at a secret address .
Why , though , is it that nobody has thought of distinguishing between addresses by using numbers , like telephone numbers , for that would avoid Internet piracy ?
Similarly , the capacity to record the name and address of the animal owner would assist in combating trafficking in pet animals , and clarification of the anti-rabies vaccine is included in the report as well as the OIE International Animal Health Code again for the purposes of effectiveness of the proposal .
I will therefore be supporting very strongly Amendment Nos 6 and 7 , even though the need to retrieve the name and address of the owner off the microchip is in some doubt , but I go for a standardisation of the chip , and only the chip not the tattoo .
&quot; If you are a publicity - minded entrepreneurial type and want to acquire an e-mail address , it will be &quot; &quot; .at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .com &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; .net &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; .org &quot; &quot; . &quot;
Europe is now acquiring a face , an address .
European companies , organisations and private individuals will get concise new addresses long since bagged by others under the current domains .
&quot; Now that the Council has pronounced itself in favour of introducing the &quot; &quot; .EU &quot; &quot; top - level domain , just a few days ago in fact , we can help , by adopting the regulation before the summer break , to ensure that registration of the first &quot; &quot; .EU &quot; &quot; addresses can begin in spring 2002 . &quot;
This private , non-profit-making company is concerned with four key Internet sectors , including DNS ( domain name systems ) and allocating Internet Protocol addresses .
The Commission proposes that European citizens &apos; e-mail addresses and mobile telephone data could be included in public lists and given out on - line only if the interested parties had given their prior consent .
The Cappato report , on the other hand , proposes that e-mail addresses and mobile telephone data should be included on public lists and each interested party could ask to have them taken off .
Just think when your mobile number and e-mail address are known not only by your own service provider but by all possible service providers in the world , who never confine themselves to selling goods but want their brand to please you , to seduce you and to belong to you .
I come from a country in which we have an opt - in arrangement , but we still can not do anything regarding , for example , people who make use of changed addresses .
Internet spamming is illegal in any case , because it is already illegal to collect addresses without authorisation , it is already illegal to use them without authorisation , it is already illegal to send messages without clearly specifying the sender and it is already illegal to send messages without making it possible for the recipients to delete their details easily from the lists .
I feel that this debate , this legislation , has now already been made obsolete by technology and practical facts . It appears that consumers now already have the facility to choose , themselves , individually , between an opt -in or opt -out system , without having to contact the sender of the message before deleting their details from the lists but simply placing the address of the sender in question on a black list so that they no longer have to receive messages from that sender .
But I ’ m positive that we can use technology to track down the home addresses of dark weblogs … Our goal isn ’ t to take down thousands of illegal blogs , but to find a way to prevent them from going up in the first place .
About a year and a half ago , the Iranian government demanded that bloggers should register and provide their names and addresses on a site called Samandehi .
However , Section 5 says that bloggers must reveal their surname , initials , and email address .
Instead , their names have been marked in little houses with individual names and addresses on it , mimicking the village that once was .
Website logs of usage information and IP addresses , for instance , can tell the police when you login to a local forum and how long you stay at the forum .
I gave her the magazines , took her address and promised to call at her home later to discuss them with her .

When I find someone who wants me to come back I write down the name and address , being careful to remember where I am and how to get back to the same street , and then with the help of my dog I return .
Many foreigners wonder why it is so difficult outside big cities to find an address in Japan .
One of Jehovah ’ s witnesses found it , and noted the name and address of a Rhode Island resident inside .
So , this book that I have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982 .
There &apos; s actually only about 20 people on each page , because we have the name , address and telephone number of every single person .
And , in fact , everybody &apos; s listed twice , because it &apos; s sorted once by name and once by email address .
So they tell you where it is , what the prices are , the address , the phone number , etc .
And Myung Sung , under some pressure from me and the translator , gave us an address on the outside of Seoul .
The job , though , came with one small downside . And that is : they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column .
If you are buying something on the web , you &apos; re supposed to put in your address and you &apos; re supposed to choose which country you &apos; re from , OK ?
We gave them our email address , suggesting that , if they write us , we &apos; ll send them a free molecule .
&quot; But you can also search in the digital world , or maybe you can write a query , saying , &quot; &quot; What is Dr. Smith &apos; s address ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
You hit send , and in five seconds , they will send you back the two closest drugstores , complete with name address and phone number .
That &apos; s cute . I do have an email address . You can just ask me .
I didn &apos;t have an exact address , but I knew his name , Abed , I knew that he lived in a town of 15,000 , Kfar Kara , and I knew that , 21 years before , just outside this holy city , he broke my neck .
Never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A.
Then take Iran itself , and what people are doing today : following what happened to Neda , people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran , any by everybody who is blogging , changing their address to Tehran , Iran , and making it difficult for the security services .
Now the mechanism , as I said , for doing this , is you need to take out anybody pointing to those IP addresses .
I sent it from my Harvard email address , because I was recently appointed a fellow there .
And there were 7,599 people that contributed to the project , or were unique IP addresses -- so about how many people contributed .
So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up .

Address by Mr Schuster , President of the Slovak Republic

– Mr President , I might have been very happy and proud on this 8 March , as we are finally going to be heard in Parliament and you , Mr President , have honoured us with an address .
Mr President , Mr President - in- Office , Commissioner , I believe that the President -in -Office identified one of the main issues here when he rightly pointed out in his address that it will be very difficult to finalise the adoption of the constitution at a later date if the process is delayed now , because our collective awareness will diminish as new players take the stage and because the political agenda develops in such a way that it is well - nigh impossible to resurrect a project after a year and a half .
We have also discussed the time limit for funding and I am pleased that the Commissioner referred to that in her address .
In my address I identified some of the key issues : obviously , the Commission ; voting in the Council ; and the seats in the European Parliament – particularly for the smaller Member States and also for the new Member States .
The speech you made yesterday , as well as your address to our group , the European People ’ s Party , leave us in no doubt as to your ability to provide the strong leadership needed .
We appreciated what you said in your address yesterday about unemployment and job creation , about combating inequality and about security .
Since this matter was not dealt with clearly enough in your address , I should like you to explain what concrete initiatives you intend to adopt in order to achieve a common European position in favour of peace and to ensure that Europe plays an important role and maintains an active presence in the process of reconstructing civil society and democracy in Iraq .
Another question put to me by many honourable Members , notably Mr de Villiers , Mrs Bonino and Mr Carlos Coelho , was the issue of relations between the Commission and Parliament , and I would like to use the expression that I used in my address , ‘ a close positive relationship ’ .
At the start of my address I referred to two major issues currently causing insecurity in Europe , namely terror and the social factors affecting employment .
Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election and in thanking you for your address earlier this morning .

The address was subsequently printed in , the leading Polish daily , under the striking title of ‘ The humiliation of a Christian ’ .
As UN negotiator for the Philippines Yeb Sano explained in his 2013 address to the United Nations , for many people , this is what climate change looks like :

I &apos; m not reading . I never read an address .
So if we go and look at this piece of content , President Obama &apos; s State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago , and look at what we find in this same data set , at the same scale , the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable .
And in the United States there is a State of the Union address given by every president since 1790 .
I firmly reject these arguments in advance as they will lead to an increase in the volume of hazardous waste being transported with all the risks which this entails for the environment and safety .
The Commission must carry out a report in advance assessing the consequences of the application of any modification of the system in order to provide the due compensation for its negative effects on prices and incomes as a result of the increase in the global income in question .

I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese / Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel &apos; s relations with its northern neighbours .
Like my group , I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which , I feel , offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection .
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who , rightly , are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference .
The common position involves a real compromise and is a clear advance on the legislation currently applicable . This hails back to the 1970s and is very incomplete , especially when it comes to labelling and consumer information .

Mr President , as medical advances contribute to a steady ageing of our populations , the burden of pension provision throughout the Union becomes ever more costly . In the UK , as in the US , Chile and Singapore and , to a lesser extent , the Netherlands , the burden on the state and succeeding generations has been significantly eased through the successful provision of supplementary second and third pillar private and occupational pension schemes , involving funds which grow to provide pension benefits following the retirement of the individuals .

It is the country with the greatest growth and with the greatest advances in terms of social modernisation , particularly in terms of education and the status of women ; however it is the country in which the emergence of a civil society , which is born of this economic and social growth , does not have adequate means to express itself in complete freedom .
Given such an inconsistent state of affairs as the European Union giving more resources and being more effective , for example , in the control of meshed drift nets , in the control of fishing , than in the field of the rafts used for illegal immigration , I would like to ask the President - in - Office of the Council if it would not in his judgement be appropriate for us to have a periodic assessment of the situation in the Straits of Gibraltar and a report on the tiny advances made in this area .
We know these measures would be difficult to implement but , in any event , any advance in this respect would save human lives and contribute to the pacification of truly dramatic conflicts in Africa .
If the best available technology is there , then the firm should be encouraged to use it . We are never going to make any advances otherwise .

I also feel , however , that it includes some major advances , and that also means in relation to current texts .
Secondly , that the candidate countries continue to make the good progress that they are making towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria and towards the full and complete enforcement of the acquis communautaire in advance of accession .

As to the IGC , I believe that work at ministerial level had already progressed as far as it could before Biarritz , and this Informal Council thus came at the just the right time to consolidate certain advances and to lay down guidelines for the final phase of the work , on which we have now embarked .
Significant progress has thus been made even if certain advances still have to be consolidated .
This enabled them to advance at different rates and / or with different objectives .
The issue has now become particularly acute , not just because of the advances in our methods of scientific investigation but mainly because the consequences of a certain type of farming aimed at boosting productivity at all costs and inspired by a free - trade philosophy have come fully to light .

The right to good administration , which Mrs Malmström also talked about , is one of the most important advances of all .
Supplementary health schemes have also developed , over and above the reasons quoted by Mr Rocard , because there is a need for improved care as the result of advances in medical treatments , which are too expensive for national health services to pay for .

Yet , despite all the advances in medical technology , the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .
But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials .
In the last 30 years , thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology , biologists have , for example , added a full one - third of the known frog and other amphibian species , to bring the current total to 5,400 , and more continue to pour in .
And during that process -- it took many years -- one of the doctors said that my recovery , my degree of advance , since the amount of head injury I &apos; d suffered , was miraculous .
&quot; Human growth has strained the Earth &apos; s resources , but as Johan Rockstrom reminds us , our advances also give us the science to recognize this and change behavior . His research has found nine &quot; &quot; planetary boundaries &quot; &quot; that can guide us in protecting our planet &apos; s many overlapping ecosystems . &quot;
If we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music -- because right now there &apos; s virtually no effort put towards that , no rehabilitative strategies , very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music -- we would come a long way .
Massive technological advance : took an incredibly deadly disease , made it solvable .
EM : Well , we &apos; ve made significant advances in the technology of the airframe , the engines , the electronics and the launch operation .
So if the field &apos; s been around for so long , why so few clinical advances ?
And many advances now , we can do that fairly readily .
As globalization and technological advances bring us hurtling towards a new integrated future , Ian Goldin warns that not all people may benefit equally . But , he says , if we can recognize this danger , we might yet realize the possibility of improved life for everyone .
You know , the important people -- you can almost read about their lives , about all the really important people that made advances , you know .
So it &apos; s not far - fetched to say that , at some point , online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance .
That was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time .
One other very positive consequence of 20th century technology , though , was the way in which other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances .
And they came down on the side of open publication , which is the right approach -- we &apos; ve briefed the White House , we &apos; ve briefed members of Congress , we &apos; ve tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances .
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs .
The point I wish to make is that the Portuguese Presidency - to which the Minister for Justice , who is handling the field of justice and home affairs , and I myself both belong - wishes to usher in a new era with this Parliament , and to foster the relationship between the Council and Parliament . This will inevitably be influenced by my parliamentary experience in this House , and of course by the parliamentary experience of that great Member of our national Parliament who is now the Minister for Justice and my colleague .
How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs ?
Rapporteur Kuhne also puts his finger on the problems regarding the financing of the Spinelli building . This is the umpteenth affair involving new buildings .
The next item is the report ( A5 - 0109 / 2000 ) by Mrs Randzio - Plath , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on a proposal for a Commission directive amending Directive 80 / 723 / EEC on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings ( SEC ( 1999 ) 404 - C5 - 0102 / 2000 - 2000 / 2065 ( COS ) ) .
I do not believe that a great many of these MEPs are satisfied with the Commission &apos; s economic administration , but we have reached a point where the majority prefer to close their eyes to what is going on than to run the risk of their electors and fellow citizens becoming fully aware of the scandalous states of affairs which make themselves felt year after year .
Madam President , as rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy reporting on Indonesia , I did hesitate for a moment before I tabled this resolution because we will certainly be having a huge debate on the relationship between the European Union and Indonesia in the autumn .
It is worth remembering that less than 20 years ago relations with Greece , Spain and Portugal were external affairs for the European Community as it then was .
Peaceful coexistence , mutually beneficial and balanced cooperation between countries and peoples , with no interference in their internal affairs , and smooth transnational relations have always been the mainstay of any cooperation between its countries .
The next item is the report ( A5-0323 / 2000 ) by Mrs Maij - Weggen , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on developing closer relations between Indonesia and the European Union &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 50 - C5-0288 / 2000 - 2000 / 2152 ( COS ) &#93; .
For in fact , the Commission is still withholding information and has still not answered questions , especially with regard to the Fléchard affair .
Report ( A5-0323 / 2000 ) by Mrs Maij - Weggen , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on developing closer relations between Indonesia and the European Union &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 50 - C5-0288 / 2000 - 2000 / 2152 ( COS ) &#93;
Obviously , it is a cause of concern to the bordering countries of Spain and Morocco , and also to the people of Gibraltar , who are rightly worried about the implications of this affair , especially as information seems to leaking out more slowly than water from a frozen pipe .
Motion for a resolution ( B5-0037 / 2001 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Security and Defence Policy , on relations between the European Union and the Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea
Report ( A5- 0009 / 2001 ) by Mr Naïr , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the Commission Communication on relations between the EU and the Mediterranean region : reinvigorating the Barcelona Process &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 0497 - C5 0630 / 2000 - 2000 / 2294 ( COS ) &#93;
After the resignation of the Santer Commission and the Buitenen affair , people thought the Commission had learnt the meaning of democratic openness and had stopped using authoritarian methods to gag its employees past and present .
In my opinion , it is possible to meet this challenge and it will provide us with the opportunity to tackle , together with them , for example , the issue of respect for human rights - a recurring subject in our relationship with these countries about which there is always a hint of interference in their internal affairs - on fresh , equal ground , which will challenge those societies - but also our own - where , for example , the issue of migration poses cultural problems and problems of integration and convergence .
We have already said this about the Echelon affair .
Issues relating to foreign affairs and cooperation have been emphasised over and above the tendency to stress the importance of economic and trade relations . The latter are no less important but must not dominate .
In addition , further to its debate , the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs has called for more light to be shed on the relationship between the displaced persons status and the regular asylum procedure .
In fact , the political pandemonium surrounding the sinister Gongadze affair has widened the chasm between Ukraine and Europe .
Whilst Commissioner Fischler recognises that the Commission &apos; s conduct in the Fléchard affair is far from exemplary , Commissioner Schreyer refused to make a declaration that this kind of behaviour can not be tolerated in future .
The Treaty provides a clear framework for formal relations between the Council and the European Parliament when legal instruments and other instruments are being drawn up in the field of justice and home affairs .
Let us also remember the scandalous Echelon affair , which shows that Big Brother intends to keep watch over the entire planet while not accepting any right of inspection itself , as proved also by the insolent and scandalous reception recently given to our committee of inquiry into the network that brought his imperial highness to power .
Furthermore , what concerns me the most is that this affair appears to demonstrate Morocco &apos; s desire to rearm itself .
According to its usual practice , the Council opts for dialogue as a method of dealing with states of affairs considered to be unacceptable .
As the case of Turkey shows , the Association Agreement is an effective instrument enabling the European Union to highlight and criticise states of affairs it does not accept .
Mr President , first of all I should like to mention that two years ago the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy asked me to produce a report on the relations of the European Union with Belarus , and I confess that I should very much like to be able to finish it as soon as possible and in a positive fashion .
He was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and was also a member of the delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council .
The record of economic sanctions in international affairs is not - alas - a very happy one .
It has already done excellent foreign affairs work through Romania &apos; s chairmanship of the OSCE and made excellent progress in its relationships with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
It is a new and low threshold in the tide of human affairs .
&quot; I remember his visit to the great symbol of that gross division , Berlin , with its wall . I remember as a boy I could understand , although I did not know about politics or international affairs , that when that man said , &quot; &quot; I am a Berliner &quot; &quot; , he said something deep and meaningful in terms of solidarity at that time . &quot;
With regard to the relationship between the European Council and the specific Councils , I would point out that the European Parliament is making an effort to speed up the negotiation of the measures you have proposed , but this is not being treated in a corresponding fashion by the Justice and Home Affairs Council .
He also wants the strange new post of High Representative for the common foreign and security policy , which is developing into a European super - minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence , but which can not be called to account politically in this area , to be integrated into the European Commission &apos; s portfolio for external relations .
The next item is the report ( A5- 0336 / 2001 ) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez - Neyra , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on a global partnership and a common strategy for relations between the European Union and Latin America &#91; 2000 / 2249 ( INI ) &#93; .
Report ( A5- 0336 / 2001 ) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez - Neyra , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on a global partnership and a common strategy for relations between the European Union and Latin America &#91; 2000 / 2249 ( INI ) &#93;
The next item is the debate on report ( A5-0418 / 2001 ) by Mr Gahler , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on EU relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran &#91; COM ( 2001 ) 71 - C5-0338 / 2001 - 2001 / 2138 ( COS ) &#93; .
The Commission welcomes the action of the judicial and administrative authorities but , nevertheless , regrets that such an affair could ever have been possible at all . This proves the need for a correct application of national laws , as well as the following Community rules in the field of international road transport operations .
Mr President , I want to use the two minutes available to me simply to respond to Mr Bolkestein &apos; s statement on the Kralowetz affair .
Crosbie Walsh , author of Fiji : The Way it Was , Is and Can Be , said the government did itself a great disservice in the Roth affair .
There are enough reasons why a politician should step down , for example , for romantic affairs that create a conflict of interest , abuse of power or a breach of confidentiality .
Did Palmer ’ s affair give rise to one of these situations ?
This episode has echoes of an earlier issue in the year , when Workers &apos; Party member Yaw Shin Leong was expelled from his party amidst allegations of an extramarital affair .
The relentless attack on WP conducted by both the PAP and the state - controlled media during the Yaw Shin Leong affair contrasts deeply with the fair - handed approach adopted by Mr Low Thia Khiang in the recent Palmer episode .
Their rebellious speech , their meddling in political affairs , and the participation of some of them in actual sedition put them in a very bad position with the rulers .
They have asked God to intervene in earth ’ s affairs , and to make a drastic change in the way things are done .
This , it says , could lead to “ a totally new situation in military and strategic affairs . ”
For instance , a Protestant chaplain at Vassar College said that ‘ a full life can best be achieved when a man — and his wife , too — are free to engage in extramarital affairs &#91; adultery &#93; , not secretly , but with each other ’ s knowledge and consent . ’ — Current Medical Reports , January 1970 .
Of this affair , Senator Sam Ervin , Jr . , said : “ I think that Watergate is the greatest tragedy this country has ever suffered ” — even greater than the Civil War .
It is an affair that has been given much international publicity .
Women who become involved in “ affairs ” often suffer from severe emotional problems .
But after the affair is over , she ’ ll feel shot down , that she ’ s a fallen woman . ”
It is estimated that three out of five husbands and perhaps as many as one out of three wives in the United States have had extramarital affairs .
He told her that she had three choices : Try to get her husband to see a psychiatrist ; get a divorce ; or have an extramarital affair with a “ boyfriend , ” and he volunteered to serve as her “ boyfriend . ”
Many persons in this situation have been led to believe that the solution rests in having affairs , visiting prostitutes or practicing self - abuse .
“ While the homosexual couples I have known have usually struggled to maintain a loving and enduring relationship , very often these ‘ marriages ’ turned out to be tumultuous affairs , with each partner seeking a position of dominance in the relationship .
Because of emotional conflicts , and various societal stresses and strains , most such love affairs do not last very long — six months to two years is probably the average . ”
It is no wonder that only “ tumultuous affairs ” follow !
Responsible for the whole affair was a sales clerk from a village named “ Albersdorf . ”
In many lands , it is considered an expression of a man ’ s prowess to have affairs on the side , even to have illegitimate children .
Men may spend much of the family ’ s money on these affairs , making less available for the wife and the legitimate children .
I began having a serious affair with one of my office nurses , and she demanded more and more of my time .
He was greedily carrying on an adulterous affair with a younger woman .
For some , an “ affair ” is a way to boost a sagging ego , a chance to reaffirm one ’ s manhood or womanhood .
Extramarital affairs have become so common in modern society that not having one is considered almost abnormal .
Popular women ’ s magazines ask openly : “ Will an affair preserve your marriage ? ”
In answer , it is often argued that an affair can make you appreciate your marriage partner more , or make up for shortcomings in your sex life .
The impression is given that if you don ’ t have an affair , you ’ re missing out on something .
Could this popularizing of extramarital affairs have something to do with the increasing number of divorces in our time ?
At the same time , it would be very surprising if there are not far more extra - marital affairs each year than there are divorces . ”
Without doubt , extramarital affairs are one of the major causes of ruined marriages .
Therefore , can having an affair ever be recommended as a remedy for a weak marriage ?
Some argue that it is best to keep the affair secret from one ’ s marriage partner .
Explain Lake and Hills : “ Affairs are usually surrounded by a protective web of lies and deceit .
So , it &apos; s Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech ; I &apos; ve got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin ; Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson , who he was having an affair with at that time .
What this means is it &apos; s no longer good enough to say that international relations , or global affairs , or chaos in Somalia , or what &apos; s going on in Burma is none of your business , and that you can leave it to governments to get on with .
We could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring - fencing ever - increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness , the Dalai Lama &apos; s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ?
In point of fact , I consider this to be necessary because we heard , following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market &apos; s visit to Luxembourg , that it is of course inevitable , a God - given fact as it were , that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service , and so more often than not , important cases handled by the Court of First Instance can not be given the attention they deserve .
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was , after all , in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO .
Mr Napolitano , the chairman , and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that , on behalf of the Commission , I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations , in a spirit of transparency .
As I did not fully understand the plan , I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs , Mr Rato , in a letter of 14 December which I have here , to ask him for more information on the document submitted .
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs .
The affair of Mr van Buitenen was conducted completely in compliance with the existing Staff Regulations and however tested , I am sure that any fair - minded person is bound to come to that conclusion .
I was under the impression that it was not possible to act if it was a national legal system which had pronounced judgement , because that would amount to interfering in national affairs .
It is not for Europe to meddle in the internal affairs of any nation .
I am one of the few engineers in Parliament , certainly in the Legal Affairs Committee which is dominated by lawyers , and can put a rather different point of view sometimes .
I think that it would have been better if the majority in this House had paid greater attention to the legal basis and had checked it more carefully , and if it had paid more attention to the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on that matter .
Mr President , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , we spent this morning discussing institutional affairs with President Jacques Chirac and this afternoon discussing budgetary matters which really amounts to one and the same thing .
I speak now for the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs and wish to focus on two aspects of the programme .
Why do I , or my colleagues in the Legal Affairs Committee , see a connection between these things ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was first and foremost concerned that the treaty provisions put into concrete terms by the Bosman judgment should also be observed in future European Union policy .
What is important to me - and my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy supported me here - is that the Copenhagen criteria , which the Czechs have also acknowledged , should continue to apply and I should like the Czechs themselves to review their own legal system , if necessary page by page , in order to ascertain if there are any laws which are discriminatory .
In the course of the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , the matter was brought to a head when our fellow MEPs from the British Conservative Party said that , in insurance , the premium is based on the risk assumed by the insurance company . For example , a woman genetically disposed to breast cancer must pay a higher premium than other women .
For the European Parliament , foreign affairs is a vital and interesting matter , and I completely agree that , having had a lifetime &apos; s interest myself in these issues , that is a proper explanation .
I should therefore like to say a couple of things about Denmark . I want to stress that 9 of the 21 ministers in the Danish government are women and that both the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance are women .
Furthermore , I have asked the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for an opinion on what action the European Parliament should take in respect of this matter .
Mr President , the case we are now considering deserves to feature in a guide to what not to do in politics in terms of managing public affairs .
I would like to stir things up by saying that if we limit ourselves to the facts , to the current state of affairs , one is much more likely to be struck by lightning than infected by BSE .
Mr President , I am surprised that Members can joke or argue about the fact that a Member of Parliament has been arrested on European Union soil . It would appear to be a very serious incident which , moreover , is linked precisely to matters we have been discussing for some time in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs can not accept the reference to other legal bases other than those given in the Commission proposal , and would like to point out that Regulation 1408 / 71 can not be amended except through the codecision procedure .
I am telling you , this is really about people who suffer from this state of affairs .
I think that this is , therefore , a political problem , not just an implausible affair and it should be cleared up in Parliament .
This could be unfortunate for the future and I would ask you to invite the Constitutional Affairs Committee to look at that .
It was a request for you to refer this to the Constitutional Affairs Committee .
I should like to point out , too , that throughout this affair , the Commission has emphasised that the discussions between it , FIFA and the other interested parties in no way affect the compatibility of FIFA &apos; s revised rules with national laws in force , and in particular with employment law .
That is why it is a good thing that the Stockholm European Council conclusions made mention of the fact that Member States now have the right to look into each others &apos; affairs as far as pension funds are concerned because , thanks to the mechanisms of economic and monetary union , what happens with pension obligations is of importance to Member States , since all must avoid having deficits which are larger than 3 % , or deficits which do not obey the Dublin rules that they should tend towards zero or even be in surplus .
I believe that , from the point of view of the internal logic of the Regulation , it is based on the fact that tiredness is a safety risk , and therefore , as the person in charge of the Directorate - General for Energy and Transport I presented a proposal of this nature , because otherwise it would be simply an issue for the Commissioner responsible for Social Affairs and not for me .
As far as Mr MacCormick is concerned , I am glad to see Mr Corbett sitting here because it is the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that is now looking at this matter , after the Bureau decided to refer it to them .
If this turns out to be absolutely impossible from a legal perspective , the law will settle the affair .
There are two parliamentary committees which deal with the matter : the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights .
However , given the wish of the participants for more and regular information , a wish that was underlined by Mrs Jackson , but which certainly reflects the feeling of many among you , the presidency intends to organise informal meetings with the MEPs during the conference at regular intervals , thus allowing an exchange of ideas to take place about the progress and the state of affairs .
Naturally , this state of affairs has also had a marked influence upon the current report , which concerns what we have discussed in previous years .
Jordanian blogger Hareega asks the rest of the world to stand aside as Iranians sort out their internal affairs on their own :
Bloggers have been reflecting on the case and the state of affairs .
That same year , on recommendation of the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Affairs , the Riksdag submitted the matter to the King , that is , to the Government .
Since Satan is described in the Bible as “ the god of this system of things , ” it logically follows that he exercises an overriding power in the political , commercial and social affairs of this world .
Because the “ Pope is responsible to no human authority , ” either in spiritual or temporal affairs .
This is not to say that in today ’ s complex and bewildering state of affairs precisely the same methods could be used .
Luther failed to perceive from the teachings of the Scriptures that Christians are to be neutral in the political affairs of the world and that they are not to participate in warfare .
“ Yet , there were many things I could not understand in spite of all this training in church affairs .
The book ’ s publishers commented : “ It suggests that a fresh start is in order and , in the present state of affairs , no theory at all may be preferable to the existing one . ”
Interestingly , the Bible does not lead us to expect that anyone will be able to make accurate predictions about our personal affairs .
They maintained Christian neutrality in political affairs no matter what hardship their refusal to shout political slogans or give political salutes might bring upon them .
As Montefiore puts it : “ There is much to be quoted ( as usual ) on the other side ; but there was a tendency to regard the whole affair of life as if it were a case of a schoolboy ’ s marks . ”

A young man ’ s first shave is no casual affair .
In July I fled the country to escape trial for the Humphrey affair and did not return until I heard that charges against me had been dropped .
This list by no means exhausts the current state of affairs , nor does it include the countless instances in the past of conflicts between nations and peoples fanned by religious fervor .
But serving Jehovah , the Most High God , is not just a one - day - a - week affair .
In 1967 , nine international town planners reporting on the state of affairs in Calcutta said that it was “ rapidly approaching the point of breakdown in its economy , housing , sanitation , transport and the essential humanities of life . ”

If you ask neuroscientists , why is this the state of affair , they &apos; ll first of all admit it . But if you ask them , they &apos; ll say , well , there &apos; s various reasons we don &apos;t have a good brain theory .
And I wouldn &apos;t even catch the response . A sad state of affairs .
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency .
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the EU , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States .
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France &apos; s refusal to lift the ban ?
This is the philosophy behind the initiative ; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies , non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible , so that it can get as close to the people as possible .
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise , but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold .
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents , local taxes and so on .
Concerning coordination with other donors and aid agencies : the Mozambique government , in conjunction with the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance ( OCHA ) , provides the principal platform for coordination of rescue and relief as expressed in the consolidated appeals they have made .
What is the Council &apos; s view of the need for coordination at European level to develop the IT sector and , in that context , of the need to set up a European IT agency ?
The idea of launching an agency devoted to information technology was presented at the Lisbon European Council in the document provided by the Swedish Government .
We already have at our disposal many agencies at a national level , which are most efficient and which are able to deal with the vast majority of cases - and also the Court of Auditors , OLAF and other departments to deal with these issues at a European level .
Cooperation between the Commission and the agencies that implement programmes in the Member States must also be able to be made more effective through other means , for example , through water - tight cooperation between the European Investment Bank and the European Anti-Fraud Office , OLAF .
Messages of concern are coming from national agencies that the agreements between them and the Commission are still not finalised and there is a lack of certainty about payment .
The second principle is that it is important for this Agency to be highly independent and we must guarantee that independence .
To conclude , the brief of the European Food Safety Agency must be confined to food safety .
I , to give a minor example , would love to know what the agency now being proposed would have done about the mad cow crisis in Britain , about the dioxin crisis in Belgium and about the genetically - modified cotton and foodstuffs , such as cotton seed oil , in Greece .
Unless this agency comes up to the standards which will give it political teeth , I do not think it will achieve much .
Today the European Commission is proposing the creation of a European Food Safety Agency , responsible for analysing all public health risks .
Not only the Commission , but also every Member State must be legally able to call upon this agency .
However , the conditions for appealing to the Agency must be drawn up so that efficient and swift action is guaranteed .
The establishment of a European Food Safety Agency will contribute greatly to achieving a high level of protection of citizens &apos; health .
Indeed , despite the fact that the creation of the European Food Safety Agency and the definition of its competencies are a fundamental point of the strategy proposed by the Commission , they are not the only point .
First of all , it embodies the commitment to completely and comprehensively overhaul legislation , to set up an independent Food Safety Agency and to organise inspection better .
For that reason it would be best if the agency did not function under the auspices of the Commission but independently and as a body that is physically separate from the Commission .
The agency must be located somewhere well - connected in terms of transport and information technology , and the area in question should have a good reputation in the area of food safety .
Yet , the creation of a European Food Safety Agency is a very positive step .
In talks , there has been a call for the agency to be located in a city in which one of our Institutions is located , as , otherwise , it could not be supervised .
Similarly , the Agency should ensure that there is transparency by giving all interested parties access to information .
This is why the new European Food Safety Agency must become a powerful and independent body which does not only inform the public but is also given specific powers to propose effective measures in good time and to investigate problems in the event of a crisis .
In the final analysis , decisions must be taken by the European Commission , and Parliament must , for example by means of a discussion on the annual report , remain involved in the work of the agency .
After all , there is a brand - new , 175 person agency being set up to monitor phone conversations .
A successful return for Benazir Bhutto does threaten the Musharraf regime , so these accusations do have a logical basis , particularly when these agencies are known for carrying out such incidents .

Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe claimed last week that his government , with the help of international agencies , had contained the cholera problem .
The separatist political parties of Kashmir are obviously paid handsomely by the Pakistani agencies to keep the pot of hatred against India boiling .

The agency will hand out costly fines to anyone not conforming to the government standards , fines that you must pay directly .
Those in the second group must notify Roscomnadzor about the beginning of their activity and store data about users ’ activity for six months , sharing everything with any interested state agencies .
For instance , they say the procedure by which bloggers and organizers of the dissemination of information work with state registries should be simple and entirely electronic , without any need to approach state agencies offline .
A short remark to start off : I understand that I ’ m dealing with a state agency , and that our suggestions will most likely fall on deaf ears , though the media will report that “ it was discussed with the industry ” and “ its comments were taken into account . ”
What could state agencies and the Internet do for us ?
Exacerbating the problem is the lack of coordination among government agencies :

“ The agency tried various means to bring about good results .
But when a story breaks that may be of interest to people outside their own community , they send it to the national news - agency bureau for that region .
This agency gives valuable pointers on making Philippine handicrafts .
“ It takes a bigoted and paranoid imagination to believe that the Jehovah ’ s Witnesses pose any kind of threat to any political regime ; they are as non - subversive and peace - loving as a religious body can be , and ask only to be left alone to pursue their faith in their own way .... they hesitate to ask for help from agencies and institutions which might be able to lift some of the burden from them .
But if your aerosol spray uses fluorocarbon gas as a propellant , three government agencies in the United States feel that the risk is too great to take chances .
Government agencies , to placate the protesters , put ever more stringent requirements on the approval of new plants .
At this time , government agencies restrict the use of fluorocarbon “ blood substitutes ” to emergency cases only , both in Japan and in the United States .
Action was not taken until a second outbreak at Niigata , Japan , provoked the government to establish a pollution - control agency .
More serious than this , however , is the fact that many of the difficulties that we are facing today are a direct result of the evident shortsightedness on the part of governments , agencies and private individuals .
When big business and government agencies delayed in solving pollution problems in Japan , people paid the price
And due to the mounting threat of nuclear annihilation there have been statements , proclamations , indictments and letters issued against governments and other agencies .
A parade of government subsidies is going to proposed big - box and stadium developments in the South Bronx , but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic , pollution , solid waste and the impacts on open space . And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it &apos; s not even funny .
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency , and had thus come under question , is abstract expressionism .
Why are we not using the data we have ? We have data in the United Nations , in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non-governmental organizations .

There &apos; s the Dodd - Frank Act , there &apos; s the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by Elizabeth Warren .
Thirdly , it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission , in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies .
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East , even though , as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki .
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market , to stabilise confidence in this market , to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety .
We have done a lot in the Balkans : the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo , the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures .
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it , which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo , would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by .
Madam President , the committee proposes to place a Charter of Fundamental Rights at the centre of the Union system , with mandatory effect upon the European Union , it s institutions and the agencies .
The possibility of creating a human rights agency as foreseen in Vienna and Cologne could help us here .
I believe that such an agency should be operational , not advisory .
The potential for an agency should also be considered in the context of wider reform of our external assistance and of externalisation as a whole .
According to the UN humanitarian agencies , several hundreds of thousands of Iraqis , including some 500 000 children , have died prematurely because of the embargo , for lack of food , medicines or adequate care .
We have already had serious problems of this kind to contend with , as has the previous Commission , but in this particular case the accusation has been levelled that DM 300 000 were allegedly paid to an agency with nothing being received in return .
I also want to give more consideration to what the agencies are doing and take a more differentiated approach to them depending on their particular roles and activities which we have not done in the past .
In addition , as I am sure you will understand , we can not get excited about new forms of bureaucracy , even if it comes along in the jewel - studded cloak of an EU agency .
Finally , I would make a plea on behalf of my group : let us not set up yet another agency .
This Parliament and the European institutions have been spawning a blizzard of new agencies all over the European Union .
Mr President , I have an interest , though not a financial one , in this subject in that I am chairman of the Northern Energy Initiative , a company which operates in the north - east of England , and has within it a renewable energy agency whose objective is to promote the development of renewable energies .
However , we would like to see the contradictory procedure shortened for the agencies .
We welcome the fact that the agencies have decided to carry out an evaluation and we expect this evaluation to be submitted by December 2000 .
To conclude , we also note that the rapporteur intends that the mandate of the European Reconstruction Agency should not be limited to Kosovo .
Whilst greater coordination is required at European level over our airspace ( i.e. Eurocontrol ) , service provision should remain at national level - the Commission has never suggested a single agency and Eurocontrol already exists to coordinate .

As Mrs Banotti has just said , the agencies have to be involved .
The Lisbon Centre has to have reliable , accurate information and be able to monitor and involve all the different agencies in as many countries as possible .
The conclusion I draw from this is that in future , to avoid this kind of emotive reaction on an emotive subject , we should have a European Union chemicals agency , which will not be the creature of the Commission , to assess risks .
May I point out that the European Patent Office is not a Community agency .
Some Member States already have well - developed inspectorates or agencies , and the guidelines will ensure that they operate them in accordance with common standards without necessarily having to change their systems that much .
Our parliamentarians and Commission officials should go on fact - finding missions to Iraq to meet members of the Iraqi Parliament , EU diplomats , international agencies and NGOs .
France would certainly seem to be the odd man out in Europe , where , in most countries , air traffic control is administered by agencies , under state supervision but open to private capital .
In conclusion , I support the proposals to strengthen the role of Eurocontrol , the pan- European agency responsible for the management of the airspace of European states , be they members of the European Union or not , in its capacity as regulatory authority .
The report is wrong to underestimate this agency &apos; s potential , but I have voted against a report which is completely unacceptable .
Moreover , the United States have never liberalised their own air traffic control , as this is managed by a single state agency .
It seems curious to me to propose another agency , more machinery , and more budgetary expenditure to duplicate work that is already taking place .
By all means involve the two sides of industry in the research work , but let us not set up yet another EU agency or body .
First , we are not calling for the creation of a new expensive agency or institute .
We do not want a new institution or agency but - as Mrs Péry , the representative of the presidency , says , and I welcome her too - a light arrangement , a light structure , which could coordinate the existing work .
As with so many EU initiatives - I am thinking particularly of the proposed food standards agency - this observatory will simply duplicate the work of other organisations , of innumerable private research companies and accountancy firms , of academic and university institutes , of trade unions and chambers of commerce , and national and local government .

I propose that a European Agency for reproductive and biotechnological medicine be created .
As is proposed in the report prepared by Mrs Zabell and adopted by the parliamentary committee , the aim would be for the European Union to be able to speak positively , with one voice , in order to guarantee the effectiveness of the Agency .
While we await the resolution of the legal questions regarding the involvement of the European Union in the Agency , my Troika colleagues and I have established a liaison committee , which will be very useful .
There will also be a need to ensure that the Agency grows in stature so that it has the power to act in every country .

The agency may sell its service to hundreds , even thousands of newspapers , radio and television stations across the nation .
Meanwhile , the agency ’ s head office monitors all the regional news items from its bureaus nation wide .

The demands we are making of the Council are not after all demands which we have plucked out of thin air , and I believe that it ought to be possible through skilful negotiation to secure something here , because the conditions are not after all impossible to meet .
Finally , there is the absolutely crucial point about establishing emission limits in relation to air and water - whether we are talking about heavy metals or dust , ammonia , dioxin , sulphur dioxide or other hazardous substances .
Obviously , the EU must create a sustainable system for protecting air , land and water .

Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating the Commission on a very timely and far- reaching communication which explicitly acknowledges the rapidly growing environmental impact of air transport and clearly recognises that this growth is unsustainable .
As was mentioned in the Communication on the protection of air passengers , the Commission intends to establish groups of experts to examine the risks to passengers &apos; health , including those resulting from cosmic radiation , with the aim of determining what these risks are and proposing the necessary measures .
Mr President , can I first of all say that I am rather surprised that this debate is entitled air attacks against Iraq .
I would like to point out that Amendments Nos 1 and 4 have caused us many problems . These amendments are proof of the European Parliament &apos; s will to rapidly extend the Agency &apos; s areas of responsibility to all sectors relating to safety , particularly with regard to licences for personnel and air operations .
We therefore share the rapporteur &apos; s conclusions , because they reveal the urgent need for the gradual adoption of technical standards guaranteeing increasingly high safety standards and in the aim , furthermore , of enabling passengers to have the utmost confidence in European air transport .
Mr President , I must also express my particular satisfaction , which is shared by the whole of the Industry Committee , with the Council &apos; s receptiveness to all of Parliament &apos; s contributions : the principle of individual charging , differentiated treatment between existing buildings and new buildings , the clear definition of exemptions , special attention to social housing , the growing importance of passive cooling in southern countries , where air conditioning systems are increasingly contributing to our energy consumption , and , of course , the emphasis on incentive mechanisms rather than penalties .
I am sorry , but in view of what I said earlier and also what Mr Jarzembowski said , we can not afford , especially in these days of political uncertainty and economic downturn , to stop air traffic to the United States or seriously put it in jeopardy .
Regarding the Community strategy on air pollution from seagoing ships , as I have said before , I very much welcome the publication by the Commission of this communication on a European Union strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions .
I would like firstly to say that I am delighted that we have reached the second reading under the best possible circumstances in relation to such an important proposal , which must protect the position of our air sector , although it is absolutely correct to say that under no circumstances must it be used to restrict competition or the entry of third countries into our sector , but rather quite the opposite .
Member States must have the opportunity to take further - reaching measures , particularly in view of the geographical differences and the fact that air - conditioning is superfluous in northern countries .
With a view to the protection of the privacy of European air passengers , could the Commission inform Parliament of the volume of passenger data which the authorities have access to and whether there is an effective filtering of sensitive data .
Madam President , allow me first of all to express my delight at the quality of this debate and at the way in which Parliament has joined together , which will help us to progress more swiftly along the road to improving air safety .
However , as part of its review of this directive , with a view to making an amending proposal in 2006 , if necessary , the Commission will also investigate the possibility of including on the label information on the greenhouse gas effect of mobile air conditioners .
Lastly , I hope that the action plan negotiations with Azerbaijan will shortly be resumed , once the direct air links to Turkish - occupied Northern Cyprus are discontinued , as this matter is clearly of deep concern to the Republic of Cyprus as an EU Member State .
You have also had the understanding of certain representatives of the European banana producers , who appear to be resigned to awaiting a solution , which you have mentioned in your speech , involving a magic formula such as the one achieved in the so - called ‘ Madeira Agreements ’ , which for the moment just has the air of a Portuguese , which , as you know , Commissioner , is more a song of nostalgia and sadness than one of hope .

In view of this change , the Committee on Transport and Tourism decided to draw up an own - initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated , both in terms of substance and the procedures the Committee might adopt to ensure that it is well informed throughout the course of negotiations , and has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the yes / no choice of consent .
We therefore expect the Commission to respond to our call for it to maintain the flow of information and to provide the responsible committee with comprehensive information about the intention to propose negotiations with a view to concluding and amending international air agreements , so that Parliament as a whole can express its opinion in full knowledge of the facts .
The Committee on Transport and Tourism has therefore decided to table this own - initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated in terms of substance , and of the procedures the committee might adopt in order to remain well informed throughout the course of negotiations and so that it has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the final decision and merely being able to adopt or reject it .
The Committee on Transport and Tourism decided to draft an own - initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated , both in terms of substance and in terms of the procedures the Committee might adopt to ensure that it is well informed throughout the course of negotiations , and has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the yes / no choice of consent .

On the other hand , the creation of the European Ombudsman provided for by Article 138e of the Treaty on European Union is clearly a federal move which serves to give the Union and the European Parliament a false air of democratic legitimacy - an expression both symbolically and in reality of &apos; more Union &apos; .
In view of this situation , and with particular regard to the air quality in cities like Athens and Madrid , we need better quality fuel for all vehicles , new or old .

We know , however , that for some reason there is not as yet enough sympathy in the European Parliament , or at least not in the European Commission or the Council , for cultural projects , or enough appreciation of their importance .
Much work obviously needs to be done here , and we also need a sense of good will as well as an appreciation of just how serious the crisis will be if legislation and the budgetary authority are at loggerheads .
In conclusion , I believe that an appreciation of mutual - interest politics is always advantageous if we advocate the interests that are important for our European economy strongly and consistently .
Another reason is the various expectations people have of the European Union in this field , and I think that in this case all the European institutions , and above all the European Parliament , have a duty not only to generate greater appreciation of the issue , but also to take supportive action so as to facilitate effective international negotiations .
I trust that the Portuguese Presidency will use its renowned skills and experience to develop European Union appreciation of the problems that confront Pakistan and I would welcome Mr Lamy &apos; s opinion on the current status of the Cooperation Agreement .

To enlarge our appreciation of this , the apostle Paul writes : “ You at one time walked according to the system of things &#91; aión &#93; of this world &#91; kósmos &#93; , according to the ruler of the authority of the air , the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience .
He does not impart his holy spirit and an understanding and appreciation of his Word apart from his visible organization .
How much better it is when the wife shows appreciation for the hard work of her husband and the husband lets his wife know how much he enjoys the meal and the neat home she keeps .
How vividly Jesus now appealed to the imagination of his listeners , knowing that imagination , besides contrast , is a powerful aid to appreciation !
We , too , want to help them broaden their view of God ’ s purposes , deepen their understanding , develop a long - range outlook toward the future , and lift up their minds and ways to God ’ s standards as they heighten their appreciation of his provisions .
This quality of appreciation must be inculcated if the student is to endure .
This appreciation for the Kingdom being instilled in him , the student will remain steadfast as a Kingdom publisher .
Aid them to a lasting appreciation of spiritual discernment , understanding and thinking ability .
( b ) Against what can appreciation of these Scriptural facts safeguard us ?
In tough economic times , our exploratory science programs -- from space probes to the LHC -- are first to suffer budget cuts . Brian Cox explains how curiosity - driven science pays for itself , powering innovation and a profound appreciation of our existence .
Because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn &apos;t promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time .
And you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network .
We need to be looking towards a new policy architecture to deal with all these questions .
I am always surprised to see our Parliament , which sets itself up as the committed champion of respect for minority rights when it comes to others , go against this approach when it comes to deciding on the institutional architecture of our own House .
Mr President , the Commission proposal which is now under discussion is to be seen against the background of the new architecture resulting from the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty .
That architecture rests on two cornerstones , namely the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice in accordance with the new Title IV inserted in the European Community Treaty , and the integration of the Schengen acquis into the Union framework , to which is added the dimension of variable geometry resulting from the different protocols annexed by several Member States to the Amsterdam Treaty .
We feel instead that the issue of Europe &apos; s prospects , the issue of the architecture of a new Europe and the issue of the future European Constitution belong right at the heart of the French Presidency of the Union .
Therefore , the rapporteur can not support those amendments which would represent profound structural changes to the institutional architecture of the Union .
Mr President , like many in the House I very much welcomed what Mr Prodi said to us this morning , both about the architecture of the Union and its institutions and about the Charter of Rights .
However , this factor indisputably pervades and conditions the whole of the rest of the architecture , all the prospects for the future , this acquired right which the peoples and countries of Eastern and southern Europe now have to join the European Union . For the countries of Eastern Europe , I would say that it takes the form of a sort of compensation for all the years that they had to suffer a dictatorship , which , despite being established in Yalta , was still a dictatorship for very many years .
However , at various different stages , always during or immediately following the Second World War , measures were adopted which do not clearly meet the Copenhagen criteria , given the prevailing spirit at the time , and yet the political and ideological architecture of the period , including the peace treaties , was founded on precisely those laws .
This Green Paper has opened the debate on the architecture of a future emissions trading system within the European Union .
From this standpoint , the large States are blocked by the rest and can not drag Parliament into supporting their views , using it against us in the future architecture of the institutions .
How are our governments to cope with their wider responsibilities in this new European architecture and the development of a common foreign and security policy ?
Therefore , to protect , preserve and promote our heritage , we must save our architecture , support our arts and craft industry , preserve and enhance the value of our countryside , but I would like to stress that we must not wrap it in cotton wool or exclude the cultural traditions and customs which are practised there .
They concern the dividing line between national and European powers , simplification of the Treaty , the legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the role of national parliaments in the architecture of the European Union .
On these four issues , then , which are simplification of the Treaties , the legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the debate on powers and the place of national parliaments in the European architecture , let us be careful not to undermine the Community acquis or weaken the Community method by tackling them in an inappropriate manner .
Mr President , as a result of the experience gained in its federal reorganisation , the Germany you lead will also have an eminent role in the great debate which the Nice Summit opened up , on its own initiative and that of Italy , via the declaration on the future of the Union . This will make it possible for us to jointly redefine the new qualitative architecture of an enlarged Union through a better balance of powers shared between Europe , the Member States and the regions .
Mr President , I assume that you want me to focus on the topic in hand until 11.00 a.m. and that I am not being given the floor to talk about all kinds of other things , for example , Chancellor Schröder &apos; s latest document on architecture of the future Europe .
So we need to look over the structures and processes of cooperation , the architecture if you like , and the plumbing of our relations , in order to ensure that the whole machinery is geared as much as possible to action and the delivery of results .
The architecture is described in terms of strategic themes forming the core of the transatlantic agenda .
The main progress of the Kyoto Protocol is , in any case , to establish the architecture and general rules of an international framework on climate change : for example , binding emission targets , the flexible mechanisms for achieving those targets , a compliance regime , support to developing countries on which further decisions can build .
Like the rapporteurs , I too would conclude by emphasising the need to maintain the link between the institutional architecture and the European projects .
The suggestion that a regulatory committee should be in place to deal with all matters concerning the system &apos; s architecture and with data protection issues , also goes against Council decision 468 / 99 . This stated that recourse should be had to the regulatory procedure only for measures of general scope intended to apply essential provisions of basic legal instruments .
Architecture , engineering , the structure of buildings , are all in the realm of science .
Firstly , whereas Nice declaration No 23 had included in the agenda a point entitled &apos; The role of national parliaments in the architecture of Europe &apos; , the Laeken Council has watered down that idea under a much vaguer title : &apos; More democracy , transparency and efficiency in the European Union &apos; .
It is a largely biased approach , since in reality the two questions are just one : recognising a prominent role for national parliaments within the architecture of Europe is the best way to reconcile the Union with its citizens .
The question of national parliaments , of the role that they must play , that they can be asked to play , in the future architecture of the Union , is related to the question of subsidiarity .
I would also like to say that , by participating in the capital of the Joint Undertaking , industry is now beginning to accept a minimal risk , and I think that is appropriate , because it must also participate in the final definitions of the architecture of the whole system .
Mr President , I would like to inform the House that at the end of the debate yesterday afternoon , Mr Napolitano , in response to statements made during the debate by myself and others , made the following offer : he suggested that we ought to withdraw Amendments Nos 18 and 12 in order that he might , through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , propose the bringing forward of a specific report on the issue of constitutional regions in the architecture of Europe .
In the future institutional architecture , the Council will be defined , on the one hand , by its power of co-legislator , on the other , by its role of guaranteeing the governability of the Union as a whole , and , in addition , by the attempt to achieve coherence between the Union &apos; s policies at all levels .
I feel that this could have been an appropriate time to introduce greater focus on the issue of the regions in the future European architecture than in the latest version , which will be put to the vote tomorrow .
Solar powered street lights in Capetown , architecture with a modern and green touch in Accra Ghana , questions about companies &apos; so called &apos; green &apos; credentials , and a cute baby gorilla in Africa .
These are well traveled and widely read ( I hope ) people who are exposed to things like good architecture , art and culture .
Using film , photography , blogging , and social media , they want the world to see Yemen for its rich art , unique architecture , and the breath - taking landscapes and scenery that the country has to offer .

Industrious , thrifty Ilocano people of the narrow valley just north of Manila retain the formal , sturdy architecture of Spanish days .
Think of man ’ s accomplishments in the fields of architecture , building , music , sports , carving , sculpture , painting and technology .
And many persons benefit from the cheaper housing that present - day architecture can provide .
Modern architecture , for all its advancement , has never been able to rival the construction of a tree .
Who taught the termites their skills in architecture and engineering ?
For example , the Woolworth Building , an outstanding example of modern Gothic architecture , was called by a clergyman the Cathedral of Commerce .
As you drive toward the old city quarter , you are struck by a marvel of ancient architecture and engineering — the aqueduct of Segovia .
Passed on to each succeeding generation , Moorish architecture , science , and technology influenced Spanish builders , farmers , and scientists alike .
“ Subtle , ” “ quiet , ” and “ delicate ” are other words that help us understand Japanese architecture and its appeal .
The visitor was afforded a unique opportunity to discover the cuisine , the folklore , the architecture , and the technology of 111 countries of the world .
And I decided that if I was good in art , and I was good in mathematics , I &apos; d study architecture , which was the blending of the two .
And I said to him what I was doing , that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together .
And it &apos; s a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body , and divided care into departments and compartments .
And it was reflected in our architecture , it was reflected in the way that we taught students , and this mainframe mentality persists today .
Next , consider making your business carbon - neutral . Again , some of us have done that , and it &apos; s not as hard as you think . Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations , whether you are from the technology , or entertainment , or design and architecture community .
Reed Kroloff gives us a new lens for judging new architecture : is it modern , or is it romantic ? Look for glorious images from two leading practices -- and a blistering critique of the 9 / 11 planning process .
So anyway , today we &apos; ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimism .
Because if architecture is what I believe it to be , which is the built form of our cultural ambitions , what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else &apos; s cultural ambitions relative to us ?
I think that the World Trade Center in , rather an unfortunate way , brought architecture into focus in a way that I don &apos;t think people had thought of in a long time , and made it a subject for common conversation .
I don &apos;t remember , in my 20 - year career of practicing and writing about architecture , a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning , fire exiting , safety concerns and whether carpet burns .
At the point where you can weaponize your buildings , you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way .
And so now we &apos; re going to think about architecture in a very different way , we &apos; re going to think about it like this .
They &apos; ve chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind , the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture .
But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents , and that these two things talk about very specifically .
And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects , in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything -- that there is a large , technical answer that can solve all problems , be they social , be they physical , be they chemical -- or something that &apos; s more of a romantic solution .
And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time .
I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized , you know , the big story from Amsterdam isn &apos;t what &apos; s in the design stores , it &apos; s what &apos; s out on the streets , and maybe it &apos; s self - explanatory , but a city that hasn &apos;t been taken over by modernism , that &apos; s preserved it s kind of architecture and character , and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected .
Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture , and the way that the trees form vertical elements .
Because we can completely control their experience , and see how that alters the architecture of their brain .
The other thing , it &apos; s generated , obviously , a lot of economic value ; it &apos; s also inspired , I think , a lot of great architecture .
But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the architecture of the space .
What I mean by that is that it &apos; s time for architecture to do things again , not just represent things .
Now , I think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today .
And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture .
&quot; And we announced , &quot; &quot; Hey , architecture , it &apos; s over here , in this autonomous language we &apos; re going to seed control of processes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
And that &apos; s when we began to sell the world that architecture was created by individuals creating genius sketches .
Now , if we do this , I believe we can go back 50 years and start reinjecting agency , social engineering , back into architecture .
One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects , because they say the first thing they have to do , the first five minutes of any show , is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron .
Well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture .
Now that , I would say , is architecture performing .
I repeat , it is a huge privilege to take part in this debate and in particular - and I say it in his presence - it is a privilege to have taken part in a debate led by Mr Lamassoure , who has done such an extraordinary job of setting up the architecture but being willing to adjust the sculpture , to borrow a metaphor of his own this morning .
Baring - Gould ) that in adopting the X P as his standard the Emperor Constantine was actuated by policy , the same figure speaking to his pagan troops of the ever - revolving wheel of the sun , and to the Christians of the initials in Greek of the Saviour ’ s name . ” — The Cross in Ritual , Architecture , and Art , p .
The complex architecture of the plant and the incredibly intricate biochemical and genetic controls that regulate photosynthetic activity may be viewed as refinements of the basic process of trapping the photon and converting its energy into chemical form . ”
Consequently , my Group will support the rapporteur &apos; s report and , above all , will particularly support Amendment No 2 , which proposes the inclusion of areas dedicated to the production of seed vetches in the aid system , as this will lead to high - quality crops .
First , the aim of the scheme has been successfully achieved and , second , the growing areas have to be brought under better control .
If , for example , the enlargement of the European Union encompasses countries such as Poland , which have large agricultural areas and a high proportion of their population working in agriculture , most of whom will become unemployed over the next 10 or 20 years as these countries engage in intensive farming , then there is room for manoeuvre here .
This is because agricultural aid is largely based either on land area or the number of livestock , and the Member State in question pays it .
The report from our Agricultural Committee also includes amendments to extend grant aid for producing flax and hemp to non-arable land , thus providing opportunities to diversify areas of the European Union unable to obtain monetary support under the present regime .
It has been suggested that the land eligibility rules should be disregarded for flax and hemp so that any land could be used for those crops , but without an increase in the base area .
This means that , even though there are almost no legal uses for hemp , the area used for hemp cultivation has quadrupled in the course of the last year .
In my opinion , they are actually no longer necessary because there is land all over the place within the surface area on which flax and hemp can be grown without limiting the amount of other crops that are cultivated .
As far as the form and content of the message are concerned , it is important that it should be clear , comprehensible and brief if it is to be noticed at once , and we therefore consider it imperative to increase the surface area covered .
Health Canada recently carried out research on the effects of increasing the size of the area occupied by health warnings on cigarette packets . The result proved that larger warning messages better encouraged smokers to stop .
About half of the surface area of a cigarette packet should be reserved for health information , to weaken the supremacy of the tobacco companies .
I am in favour of warnings on packets , but not in favour of a skull which takes up 60 % of the surface area .
We need reliable information on final beneficiaries , the number of animals kept and the surface area being cultivated .
With regard to Amendment No 1 , the Commission &apos; s main motivation in presenting this proposal was firstly to adjust the integrated control system to the new legislative situation arising from Agenda 2000 , secondly , to introduce the geographic information systems designed to improve the identification of agricultural areas and , thirdly , to stipulate compatibility between IACS and administration and control systems for other Community aid systems .
But IACS or the geographic information system will also be used for determining areas and for drawing up the olive sector register .
For example , if you look at the European Court of Auditors &apos; Statement of Assurance and in particular at the representative spot checks carried out by the Court of Auditors for 1998 , the following facts emerged with regard to the support system for producers of arable crops : out of the entire random sample taken , a total of 16 substantial errors were found in relation to area .
Only 10 % of the surface area destroyed in Greece is reforested .
This Directive provides a framework for consolidating legislation which has been in existence at national and European level concerning the whole area of the safety of surface water and ground water .
I believe that the area destroyed by the fires was twice as large as at any other time and a great many people were killed despite the fact , of course , that the Greek Government was well prepared and despite the fact that Greece now has some of the best fire - fighting equipment , aeroplanes and human resources in the world .
There are machines which can clear large areas of mines in a short period of time .
The Court , therefore , quite rightly concluded that support for farmers should not be provided on the basis of price , production or area , but of support for the net income of farmers or of agricultural work units .
There was often a good reason why our forefathers did not build on these areas because they flood .
And I would like to welcome Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf with his bow tie , maybe that is a reference to the fact that he now has clover grass , but we could also use Lucerne grass , that is just as good . Can you tell me why we do not use pulses , which we urgently need as a substitute for animal meal in these areas , and why does everything necessarily have to be organic ?
For example , on page 17 we have Figure 17 , which is about permissible configurations for rear corner seats , and shows a plan view of the prescribed seat area , with both rear corner seats , in relation to Annex I Section 7.7.8.6 .3.4 , and as with aircraft design a maximum radius of 150 mm is prescribed .
In making such decisions , account should be taken of the number of jobs dependent on these areas .
For example , without taking sides , Europe could support Belgian efforts to bring some stability to a population of over 55 million men and women in a land area larger than that of the enlarged Europe .
The new , independent Ukrainian state , comparable in area and population with France , is now unfortunately a country in crisis .
Agricultural aid does not encourage over-production , because it is not connected to the volume of production and is based on surface area and number of livestock .
Thirdly , encouraging extensive production makes sense but this must be accompanied with a special premium entitlement for small farms , which will not benefit from these incentives because they cover too small an area .
I would also like to talk about energy policy , environmental protection , sustainable development , security , social and territorial solidarity and also about local development , about developing balance between geographical areas and about everyone &apos; s right to energy .
In Finland , for example , 30 % of the land area is bog .
In addition , aid will also be granted for woods and areas belonging to the local , regional and national public sector in the future .
Given that , as Mr Ebner has just said , mountain regions account for around 30 % of the land area in the EU , while in many Member States , such as Austria , they account for as much as 50 % , I welcome and support this own initiative report .
If you draw two lines on a map of Europe , one from London to Milan and the other from Copenhagen to Barcelona , and 200 kilometre corridors along each side of the lines of this X , you will have 65 % of Europe &apos; s population and 80 % of Europe &apos; s manufacturing sites , including the dangerous ones , within this restricted area .
Therefore , it also includes people who merely have limb impairments , are of small stature , pregnant women etc . It also states that all sloping areas in vehicles must have a non-slip surface .
One such plant , Petrola Hellas plc , is located a stone &apos; s throw from the densely populated areas of Elefsina , Aspropyrgo and Mandra and has already applied for planning permission to extend over a 130 hectare plot of land located in the buffer zone between the current Petrola plant and the Pyrkal munitions factory .
One cause for criticism is the fact that the land area of regions has not been used as a basis for statistics .
For example , this sort of administrative division ( prefecture ) has a surface area of 2,950 square metres in Greece , 3,162 square metres in Portugal and a mere 758 square metres in Germany .
In this regard , Mr Aznar , I would like to make the following comment : a Union of 27 States - with enlargement to a further 10 States - will increase the surface area of the European Union by 34 % , it will increase the population by more than 28 % , but the Community income will increase by barely 5 % .
We also wanted to define those buildings which are excluded from the application of energy - saving measures and , also , in order that our proposal is not rejected , we have proposed , like Mr Vidal - Quadras , that we accept the Commission &apos; s proposal aimed at reducing the area of the buildings affected .
We therefore believe that as outlined previously and in terms of hectare as in Mrs Ayuso &apos; s amendment adopted in committee , namely certified areas , this report presents an approach the Commission should certainly consider .
In one part of the camp , a huge area stretched before us , where , just last month , dozens of three - or four - storey blocks of flats stood . All that is left of these are the ends of the metal scaffolding sticking out of the ground .
More vegetable fuel means that a larger area of agricultural land is required , and that this land will be worked intensively .
Thirdly , increased aid for oilseeds would bring us back into the Blair House Agreement &apos; s restrictions on areas cultivated with crop - specific aids .
Nearly 10,000 small - scale coffee and cocoa farmers spread across 21 communities are involved in the project , which has now reforested close to 1 million acres ( close to 400,000 hectares ) — an area larger than the state of Rhode Island .
If this were spread out over an area of one square mile , it would make a mound of earth nearly nine feet high !
When choosing colors , remember that when a paint is spread over a large area it will appear darker than it does on a small color sample .
In less than a week fires burned 680 square miles of southern California — the equivalent of an area ten miles wide and sixty - eight miles long !
The ground in the area of Saint - Jean Vianney is made up in part of a surface layer of sand on top of clay that is 135 feet deep in some places .
These tiny alveoli , if spread out , would cover an area of a hundred square yards or more .
Here 72,000 sheets of corrugated metal covering a thirty - four - acre area catch the rain and channel it into the reservoirs .
From this mound we can see how extensive the Roman city was ; the later Crusader town occupied only about a sixth of the area of the earlier city .
When large areas of one family of grains are grown , the entire crop is exposed to a serious hazard .
So planting larger and larger areas of a crop with too narrow a genetic base is a very dangerous procedure , and shortsighted .
These each track the sun across the sky and reflect it s rays onto a fixed point on a huge parabolic reflector , which , in turn , focuses the many rays on an area only about twelve inches wide .
Because when a large area is planted with a single grain crop it is vulnerable to affliction by a single devastating plant disease .
If the many fragments were joined in a giant jigsaw , the total area of 7,022 square miles would almost equal that of the state of New Jersey .
Each building is a 209 - foot square — about an acre in area .
When that dries , sand it smooth and then apply a primer on these areas so that they will not show through when you paint over them .
Their roots may be only four or five feet deep , but they can spread out to gather nutrients from an area 400 feet across — perhaps two acres .
Some 614 feet long , with an overall area of about 163,000 square feet , the building can accommodate an estimated 80,000 persons .
They multiply to such a high density that large areas of water are turned red , brown or amber by their pigments — a phenomenon known as a “ red tide . ”
Covering an area of thirteen acres , the Great Pyramid has a square base and triangular sides , each facing one of the four points of the compass .
Incidentally , the fovea is only about one square millimeter in area , about this size : .
A large area recently was reclaimed from the sea to provide new port facilities and to allow for town expansion .
Being elastic , the skin also permits the effects of a fall or a blow to be spread over a large area and thus reduces the extent of the injury .
And any area the size of a baseball diamond infield becomes our own private airport .
The Encyclopædia Britannica states : “ Proportion has to do with the organization of amounts and areas ; the traditional Japanese rule that an arrangement should be at least one and a half times the height of the container is a generally accepted use of this principle .
August 7 , 1975 , was a memorable day for a small Central American country with a population of a little more than four million and an area of just 21,000 square kilometers ( 8,100 square miles ) .
This provides a large area for the specialized and extremely powerful flight muscles to be attached on both sides of the chest bone .
Furthermore , Kepler showed that a very curious law holds true : the line drawn between the sun and any planet will sweep out equal areas in equal periods of time .
Then , by Kepler ’ s second law , the area of the two shaded sections will be equal .
From this it can be seen that a planet would travel faster when it is nearer the sun , in order for an equal area to be produced .
If it takes the same amount of time for a planet to travel from T1 to T2 as it does from T3 to T4 , then shaded sections will have equal areas
This gave the artists plenty of time to indulge their tastes in interior decoration , so much so that some murals cover very large areas and contain a multitude of both animal and human figures .
During the first 10 days of May , the rough rice seed is sown in well - prepared beds or plots in a small area of a paddy .
Each person transplants the seedlings in the area immediately within his reach .
Good housekeeping includes keeping the stove and surrounding areas grease free .
Do you have the furnace — also flue pipes , chimneys , and areas around the furnace — checked and cleaned regularly by a qualified repairman ?
Including the Tocantins , it is an area of 2,700,000 square miles ( 7,000,000 km ) , or about the size of Australia .
The sun ’ s radiation falling on an area only 16 miles ( 26 km ) square in Arizona carries energy equal to that generated by all the electric power plants in the U.S.
This principle is applied on a large scale , using curved mirrors , to concentrate the sun ’ s rays to a dazzling white heat on a small area , hot enough to melt the most refractory materials .
We have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use .
So I thought of an idea -- what if we collect the sun with a large reflector -- like I had been thinking about way back when , when I was in high school -- but maybe with modern technology we could make a cheaper , large collector , concentrate it to a small converter , and then the conversion device wouldn &apos;t have to be as expensive , because it &apos; s much smaller , rather than solar cells , which have to be covering the entire surface area that you want to gather sun from .
Now if we go to the area , lots is worse than nuclear or wind .
For wind , there &apos; s a larger area , but much smaller footprint .
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds .
So , the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan , places that are close to water , places that are near the harbor to fish , places protected from the winter winds .
You would say -- yeah , yeah , yeah , we all know this ; water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land .
Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration .
The volume of a lung is very small , but what about the area of the lung ?
The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain , and to increase the area that &apos; s available for mental capacity , the brain surface is highly folded .
Anyway , the American cities : lots of roads dispersed over large areas , almost no public transportation .
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines , deletes provisions which are no longer applicable , and lays down the procedures for a ) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b ) enacting less stringent national regulations , in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas .
This , as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity , exacerbates the exodus from rural areas .
Therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set . We want rural areas , at the dawn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi-functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities .
That way the much - trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform .
&quot; If these changes to the report are supported by the House today , I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about , namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living , not by giving a hand - out but by giving a &quot; &quot; hand - up &quot; &quot; . &quot;
As regards rural development , which a number of you brought up , particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez , the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas , but also protection of the environment and Europe &apos; s rural heritage .
At this stage , I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas , in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions .
We now require an in - depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union &apos; s more remote areas .
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand - orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas .
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well , and the result , which we have received today , is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area . This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280 ( 4 ) .
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal , rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs , which are no longer solely connected with agriculture , in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also , for instance , in rural tourism , sport and cultural activities , environmental projects , SMEs , services , and so on .
On the one hand , by asking the Commission , within the scope of aid to the fishing industry , to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected , and also by asking them to demand , of international bodies and of themselves , tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience .
In this area we must respond to public opinion .

Just last week , in a New York Times article dated January 26 , 2010 , it was revealed for the first time that officials at the National Security Agency were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks in cases where the U.S. was about to be cyberattacked .
&quot; This book , &quot; &quot; Finding Darwin &apos; s God , &quot; &quot; by Kenneth Miller , is one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design that I know , and it &apos; s all the more effective because it &apos; s written by a devout Christian . &quot;
But also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country .
This is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the 9 / 11 attack .

About a year after 9 / 11 , researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack .
What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks ?
And on the vertical axis you &apos; ve got the number of attacks .
You take all of the conflict , all of the chaos , all of the noise , and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict .
And we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack .
At the time I was photographing in these different places , I thought I was covering separate stories , but on 9 / 11 history crystallized , and I understood I &apos; d actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years , and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation .
We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it -- which is sometimes something that &apos; s quite hard to do , when you &apos; re talking about giant databases of information -- release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .

People date the beginning of this new era to 9 / 11 , but surely 1983 , with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks -- which Sergio witnessed -- those are , in fact , in some ways , the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today .
The good news , for what it &apos; s worth , is after Sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N. , the military created a search and rescue unit that had the cutting equipment , the shoring wood , the cranes , the things that you would have needed to do the rescue .

An interesting point brought up by Dr. Shahid Masood ( a political commentator on the ARY channel ) was that he was personally informed by Benazir Bhutto that she had sent a letter to Pervez Musharaf , prior to her traveling to Pakistan , listing out the names of three ( political ) personalities who should be investigated as possible suspects , in case she was killed in an attack upon her arrival to Pakistan .
&quot; The number of cases of torture and worse in Egyptian police stations that have come to light in recent months is staggering , &quot; &quot; notes the post . &quot;
Whoever hasn &apos;t showed up , or spoiled the ballot , or cast a vote for a non-winning party - this person has given his / her vote to the leader as a gift ( in our case , to the United Russia ) .
This is the harshest sentence in a similar case for the last ten years according to Gasser Abd al Razeq from the Human Rights watch .
Ibn Al Dunya , however , remains pessimistic that such high profile cases would root out corruption and human rights abuse in his country .
Human Rights Organizations claims that torture is widespread and systematic , something that the state refutes , allthough it admitts to occasional cases were individuals make mistakes .
There are ample cases to suggest that the opposite is still the norm .
The Green Cross Corporation ( now Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation ) was involved in both cases , and as vcccttea writes :
After that his family will be allowed to visit him and be informed about his case and the possible charges that might be brought against him .
It is difficult for me to comment on this case because it seems like such an absurd action to warrant imprisonment , especially because Fouad did not commit fraud or even damage the reputation of the Prince ( I did read several different versions of the events and some painted Fouad in a more scandalous light ) .
Other than the Arabic forums , there has been very little coverage or discussion online about their situation , unlike previous cases of bloggers being arrested or brought to prosecution .
Murphy of Washington , D.C. , said : “ There is an attitude that these cases must be moved through .
More than 10,000 cases were filed during eighteen years .
A notable case was the reentry , on March 3 , 1968 , of a Russian satellite that failed to lift out of its parking orbit .
Even with all these possible causes of UFO reports , the fact that there are still cases on record that have not been explained suggests that radar sometimes behaves in ways that are not completely understood .
In summary , probable or certain explanations in natural causes were found for all but a handful of the cases examined .
They may even help to prevent disease , as in the case of those on antimalarial drugs in countries where malaria is still rife .
Yet this simply could not be the case , for the dead are not conscious .
Since there were 266 malpractice cases decided by appellate courts in the United States from January 1 , 1946 , through June 1956 , this indicates there may have been some 26,000 suits filed during the same period .
In one case a spinal anesthetic given to a woman caused respiratory difficulties , and cardiac arrest ( heart standstill ) , resulting in irreversible brain damage .
In another case a doctor ’ s wife was given a general anesthetic , even though she had eaten a full meal and a midnight snack within six hours of the onset of labor .
In the case of Libya , it was a lot of fun meeting Qaddafi in his tent .
This little relief on the footplate , by the way , to a rider means there &apos; s something going on underneath it -- in this case , a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably , taking the power from the engine .
Well in this case it isn &apos; t , because it &apos; s a very , very ecologically - sound piece of technology .
Now , children below the age of consent are a special case .
In that case , a parasite gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .
In this case , they &apos; re both wobbling quite a lot .
We have another well - known case -- Gustavo Dudamel .
which was indeed the case in Europe between 1650 and 1750 .
Just last week , in a New York Times article dated January 26 , 2010 , it was revealed for the first time that officials at the National Security Agency were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks in cases where the U.S. was about to be cyberattacked .
Would you like to try a more standard calculator , just in case ?
We decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar -- so in this case , we have carrot cake .
Nevertheless , we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid , trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings , that are going to be very very difficult to address -- as we &apos; ve seen in the case of HIV .
That &apos; s no longer the case . Logging roads provide access to urban areas .
In this case , the Opto - Isolator is blinking in response to one &apos; s own blinks .
And in my case , when I hit send , up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds .
In this case , this guy &apos; s not liking what he &apos; s hearing .
The war is so worrying at present , with court cases coming up in one state after another , that I felt I had to say something about it .
&quot; Contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism , called &quot; &quot; Intelligent Design , &quot; &quot; or ID . &quot;
But in any case , that was more than 100 years ago .
So when you hear about corruption , don &apos;t just feel that nothing is being done about this -- that you can &apos;t operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption . That is not the case .
Swedish taxpayers , who also pay net amounts into the European Union , are in fact at a loss to understand the madness of travelling backwards and forwards with thousands of cases every month .
This is an embarrassing example of how a project aimed at giving shape to a European Union foreign policy can ultimately stumble over a few cases of tomatoes .
Mrs Aelvoet has already mentioned agricultural products . An agreement should not hang on a case of tomatoes .
I would also like to congratulate Mrs Aelvoet because she has worked hard to keep those cases of tomatoes out .
Such planking may be obtained from a variety of sources : discarded furniture ( wardrobes , headboards , tabletops ) , old packing cases , beams from demolished buildings , and old fence posts .
She related : “ He took me into a wild - looking cave a few hundred feet &#91; more than 50 m &#93; from the beach and finding a case of brandy , broke a bottle and made me swallow some , which revived me .
Twenty - five large cases were filled and shipped back to England .
Now , in case the weather changes before the launch , they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station .
This was , after all , one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission .
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency .
The correct speculative approach , it seems to me , is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos , rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets .
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises , it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued can not be averted through taxation .
In order to remove these causes , one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question .
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring , on the one hand , that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that , on the other hand , there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses .
This requires action to address the underlying causes , including an examination of the electoral process itself .
The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism . It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further .
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation .
However , nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it .
Otherwise , in my view , we are beavering away at the symptoms , but not the causes .
Although the cause was unfortunate , it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament .
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries , barring a few exceptions .
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem , i.e. Communism .
Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work - related causes .
Once again , there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe .
The blogger adds that the real causes of mental security problems are the economic crisis and repressive government policies .
Wen has criticized the U. S and some enterprises for the cause of the crisis , blaming them as irresponsible and immoral .
I have to agree with readers that whatever the cause , Government has made a serious mistake in deporting the Fiji Water CEO .
&quot; They are demanding a &quot; &quot; citizen rescue &quot; &quot; , as well as a clarification of the causes of the catastrophic bank situation . &quot;
The disease is incurable at the moment and it s cause is not known .
Ugandan villagers complain that samples were taken to USA since 2010 , but they have never received any reliable information about the cure and cause since that time .
Let me chant , I can ’ t , I can ’ t as she has forgotten my cause !
Antje Schrupp writes about the newsworthiness of sexism and investigates the causes of this debate :
Culture Minister K C Joseph invited controversy when he stated that the consumption of alcoholic drink arrack by expectant tribal mothers was a major cause of death of infants in Attappady adivasi belt .
One of the persons on the President ’ s Commission on Law Enforcement stated : “ Thorough as the Commission ’ s studies have been and comprehensive as its valuable recommendations are its report seems deficient to me in that it neglects to recognize godlessness as a basic cause of crime . ”
Of these , they decided that 94 percent could be explained through natural causes .
They find it easier , quicker and cheaper to go to the drugstore than to determine the cause of their problem and deal with it .
Thus , where possible , the wise course is to treat the cause of the pain rather than simply mask the symptom by means of pain - killing drugs that act on the brain .
Investigation traced the cause of death to the hospital ’ s laundry , where a mildew - preventing chemical was being added to the wash water .
What abundant cause for exultation and joyfulness God ’ s redeemed people therefore had !
Among the more immediate causes are growths or polyps that close the ducts leading from the sinuses or , more often , inflammation of the nose , which may spread to the mucous membranes of the sinuses .
Yet the laws of cause and effect work as inexorably in the case of one as in the case of the other , and of how infinitely much more value are their bodies than their autos !
A primary cause for the eruption of intense opposition to it seems to be the recent move to teach it in elementary or grade schools .
If educators feel that parents are not now equipped to teach their own children or will not take the responsibility to do so , then why not deal with this cause rather than coping only with the effects ?
Now , in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS , we &apos; ve developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together .
So I think that the oil blowout , the bank bailout , the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause .
So to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer , I went back to look at cancer &apos; s causes .
The causes of this are really complicated , and I don &apos;t have time to go into them .
And I don &apos;t think Sunday football - watching and general laziness is the cause .
Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together ; now it is the most significant cause of the country &apos; s disintegration .
So in this way , by doing this kind of test , we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors , something that is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to do right now in humans .
There &apos; s all kinds of natural causes of climate change .
So those are all natural causes of climate change .
And then we have the human - induced causes of climate change as well .
That so many of the city &apos; s most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom , is cause for celebration .
The economy grows , government accumulates more resources , and the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth .
When so many women and girls are beaten , raped , maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes -- honor , religion , nationality -- what allows women to replant trees , to rebuild societies , to lead radical , non-violent movements for social change ?
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I &apos; d like to share with you all today .
For one , overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty .
And the World Health Organization predicts by the year 2020 that depression will be the second largest cause of disability .
But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA .
And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity .
Well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring .
What are the causes ? Well , it &apos; s an unintended consequence .
I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR .
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace , although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible .
Parliament is obviously always pleased when the Commission fights at Parliament &apos; s side as its partner and does not necessarily rush obediently to the Council &apos; s cause .
Whilst I respect the commitment of the rapporteur to his cause , I suggest to the House that is nonsense .
Firstly , to abandon all hypocrisy and treat all countries in the same way ; secondly , to commit ourselves to defending , at all costs , human rights everywhere , including in the economic field , in factories ; thirdly , to show a special concern for human rights throughout the world , in Latin America ( in Mexico , in Argentina , in Peru ) etc . ; fourthly , to accept unreservedly the cause of human rights for women ; and lastly , to recommend the ratification of the International Criminal Court .
We take the view that a good cause , namely the fight against racism and xenophobia , is being abused for extraneous objectives and that the report deals with topics which have nothing to do with racism and the fight against racism and xenophobia .
A neutral , objective judgement will serve the cause and the individual concerned , condemnation of colleagues by colleagues will not .
On behalf of the ELDR Group , I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Plooij - Van Gorsel , for a good report and for her extremely enthusiastic work for this cause : your views have the full support of my Group .
We do not feel there is cause for concern but we would certainly like the matter to be clarified , and I would like to say that we regard the Spanish compromise managed by Mr Solana as non-negotiable .
Quite the opposite - it actually harms the cause .
However , I do not believe extending EU competence to this area is either necessary or useful to its cause .
The best tribute we could pay to those people who , through that declaration , sowed the seed which has borne such abundant fruit in terms of peace and well - being , would be to commit ourselves to the cause of that beleaguered country , to decisively help the people of Sierra Leone to re-establish peace and , through peace , the full respect for human rights and the possibility of economic development which will lead it out of poverty and allow it finally to live in dignity .
At the end of the day , we are relying on the political will of society as a whole to commit itself to a cause which is related to democracy and human rights and which transcends all cultures and religions .
I believe that France , once again , has the opportunity to champion the cause of Europe .
I should like to say that I am still convinced that we are not going to have to work so hard over such a long period to persuade Prime Minister Jospin to at last grasp the European cause firmly .
That is certainly a cause about which I feel very strongly and which I know President Prodi and the rest of the Commission will be arguing with vigour and passion over the next few years .
I would urge you to trust the French Presidency of the Council and the European Council to further the cause of extending qualified majority voting .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I regret having to speak once again to defend the cause of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi .
I abstained in the vote on this never - ending resolution on enlargement because I believe that Parliament would be doing a disservice to the politically important and worthy cause of eastward and southward enlargement of the European Union to the south and east with this semi-digestible screed of paper .
Despite all the inconsistencies and superfluous proposals , which do nothing to help the cause , I did not want to vote against the report at the final vote .
This is a cause to which he has demonstrated his ongoing and productive commitment .
Sadly the common cause of Europe was a marginal factor .
I believe this would be extremely harmful to the common cause to which we dedicate all our strength .
I would say to the Commissioner : please ensure that if we are going to give money , we do it efficiently and effectively so that it does good rather than damage to the European cause .
Madam President , in response to what Mr Cohn - Bendit said , I would just like to say that personal actions are to be admired as long as they are for a good cause .
First of all , I congratulate Mrs Rothe , who successfully negotiated on behalf of all Members of Parliament . Next , Mrs Zackari , who ensured there was flexibility during the Swedish presidency and who , in fact , steered the Council towards a compromise that was acceptable to Parliament , and finally , Mrs De Palacio , who represented all those in the Commission who fully support the cause of renewable energy sources , without whom Parliament would not have been able to reach the compromises made with the Council .
One group of people really does deserve credit : the civil servants of the European Union , both those who have contributed to the design and development of the reform programme and those who , in a time of turmoil , have shown patience , understanding and commitment in thinking up the ideas , considering the proposals being made , suggesting improvements and showing the goodwill that demonstrates a high standard of professional commitment to the cause of Europe .
And , secondly , the European Union must have a single commitment and that commitment is the cause of peace .
Regrettably its blind allegiance is paradoxically damaging to Israel &apos; s cause .
If both we and the US work together in common cause , there is just a possibility that we could halt the continuing slide into regional conflict and restore peace negotiations once again on the basis of the Mitchell recommendations .
They fought a different cause relevant to their political struggles but with the same intentions of liberation as of the youth of today .
By favoring Palestinian cause , Tunisia would send the message that not all victims are equal .
I find it easy to join this local songster and chant with him when we fall upon international organizations and governments who deafen their ears to our cause !
He was condemned to forced exile in the United States following the Indonesian invasion of his country , and for 24 years he defended the Timorese cause at the United Nations ( UN ) and in the global capitals .
The cause of human rights has lost a staunch fighter who courageously stood up in defence of fairness and the just treatment of unfortunate migrant workers who are often exploited and mistreated by unscrupulous employers and agencies .
So much so that my parents and grandparents know with confidence that I do not fight wrong causes .
Israelis are convinced that media around the world is one - sided , anti-Israeli , and heavily biased towards the Palestinian cause .
This strength stems from a firm belief in their cause , says Nour , who addressed the perpetrators saying : “ Despite being capable of committing such horrid crimes , you are weak .
What has changed since that would lead Kuwait to join with its Arab allies in a potentially controversial and sectarian cause that could rock the boat with its Shiite allies at home ?
Armando Garcia , a delegate for practices and customs , has called on the general public and other indigenous groups to support their cause and join their camp .
A camera team at Essen , after taking pictures of the drama , which depicted the courageous devotion of Queen Esther to the cause of God ’ s people , were so impressed that they remarked : “ This was the best nonprofessional acting we have ever seen . ”
They have the right then to destroy anything and anyone by any means if it will help advance their cause . ”
Some of the Protestant princes , who had been indifferent to the Protestant cause up until now , were awakened to the real danger that was facing them .
Next to take up the cause of German Protestantism in this war that was to last thirty years was the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus , a military genius .
Gustavus , in the matter of two years , from 1630 to 1632 , succeeded in turning the tide in favor of the Protestants ; thereafter theirs was no longer a lost cause .
The excuse that the churches often give for backing their country ’ s wars is that their country ’ s cause is just — it fights only “ just wars . ”
Does not every nation that becomes involved in a war claim that its cause is “ just ” ?
In France and England , too , churches rallied to the support of the national cause .
“ If the soldier is convinced that with the cause for which he is fighting is involved the welfare of humanity as a whole , including , therefore , in the long run that of Germany also , he can not only shoot the German in the trenches opposite without any feeling of personal dislike , but he can do so for the love of man ....
The summer of 1940 was a dark time for the Western nations supporting the Allied cause in World War II .
We were assured that we were fighting for a righteous cause .
True , there is a blessing in giving out of right motives , but a person would reasonably want assurance that he is giving to deserving causes .
Yes , why bring disaster to oneself in behalf of a cause that can provide no guarantee of a secure future , as can God ’ s kingdom by Christ ?
The Medical Tribune states : “ Cigarettes are one of the major causes of death in the United States , yet most governmental bodies have repeatedly demonstrated an unwillingness to protect the public or , worse than that , act to aggravate a malignant situation through subsidies to tobacco growers . ”
One preacher was jubilant , calling the results “ the greatest day for the cause of conservatism and American morality in my adult life . ”
At the same time they are on the lookout for a “ cause , ” something to give their life direction or purpose .
According to a captured German terrorist , a would - be escapee is faced with the same dilemma as that of the soldier on the battlefro nt who suddenly discovers he is fighting for the wrong cause .
But at least they hope their terrorism will draw public attention to their cause .
In order to activate more people for our cause , we held a teach - in at Berlin ’ s Technical University the evening of November 29 .
Well , after all my services , sacrifice and suffering for the cause , I thought I would have a good job in Taiwan .
Yet surely both sides could not have been fighting for a just cause or with a right intention .
By attending meetings with others of similar ideals , I was imbued with fervour for ‘ the cause ’ — freedom for the Irish !
Along with others , I harassed army and police patrols , shouting at and spitting on members of the security forces and sharing in demonstrations in favour of the Republican cause .
In my eyes , this was a military funeral and the priest ’ s involvement implied God ’ s approval of our cause .
What we &apos; ve done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea , hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause , hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate .
But the pro-E.U. sentiment in Turkey in the past decade has become almost an Islamic cause and supported by the Islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well , of course .
And that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
I &apos; ve spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good cause , which is self - improvement .
One of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two NGOs to thousands in 90 countries around the world , working together in common cause to ban landmines .
&quot; Now this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question , which is , &quot; &quot; What percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
And all this TV and Internet exposure has led to a great many recruits to our cause .
And before you know it , any social cause can be actually financed in this way .
We changed our logo , for the day , from the alien to a Splashy , to sort of help the cause .
Big Brother : We are one people with one will , one resolve , one cause .
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common ; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause .
And people who believed what he believed took his cause , and they made it their own , and they told people .
It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life .
Reading now what happened then , not even a year ago , it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform , as is maintained today , so much so that this second report - which , on the other hand , could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases , since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report .
I do not know if there is some cause - and - effect at work here , but the fact is that the proportion of female Members in the European Parliament went from 25.7 % in 1994 to 29.9 % in 1999 .
I wonder whether the French presidency believes there is cause for examining this case on the basis of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty .
In another case a petition from a Spanish citizen , acting for an environmental association resulted in infringement proceedings being brought against the Spanish authorities in relation to the Habitats Directive , a frequent cause of complaint - the directive , not the authorities - with lasting national effect .
I think there should be specific deadlines by which the European Commission must be notified if there is any cause for concern .
Portugal and Belgium have , on this occasion , had a greater influence than France , which conceded on everything and obtained nothing apart from preserving a vague cultural exception , which is a pretext for a new concept , which Mr Védrine has invented , for the sake of the cause , of a sovereignty that would be both national and exercised jointly .
It is my view that we should analyse this issue extremely carefully and confirm that we certainly all have good cause to be grateful to NATO for it s past and future interventions .
This is an initiative that gives great cause for concern and we must be aware that , in this case , this will clearly discriminate against women who wish to participate actively in politics .
Proof of this lies in the reports that have been tabled here today . However good they may be , and for that we can thank the rapporteurs , they still do nothing more than list the many cases in which fundamental rights are giving cause for concern .
My own country , Portugal , will certainly devote a great deal of affection and support to Timor , since it has become both a Portuguese and a universal cause .
In relation to this incident , the Commission notes that the human rights situation in Laos PDR , including the case of the Laotian students who organised a demonstration for freedom and democracy in Laos PDR in October 1999 , continues to give cause for concern .
We know that we still have it in the UK and although in the coming year it may be that other Member States have more cases than us , that is not a cause for satisfaction for us , but rather for commiseration with those who are still discovering the full horror of what this may mean for them .
The situation is certainly not the most encouraging , there is certainly no cause for optimism in our - at last serious - commitment to the Developing World , but the Commission undertakes to work in this sphere .
Other types of problem remain , however , which are today entirely undeniable , especially concerning security and the fight against terrorism , but also concerning the fight against corruption and money - laundering as well as promoting democracy and human rights which , in the particular case of Lebanon , are a cause for concern .
Mr President - in- Office , as you will understand , both the matter of the European prisoners in Guantanamo and the conditions they face and the matter of the transfer of confidential data to the United States on airline passengers give us cause for distrust and concern about the agreement and about the stand which the European Union will maintain .
I have always believed that in any discussion about natural disasters - knowing , once again , that they do not all have natural causes , and there was nothing natural about the Prestige and the Erika - whatever the truth of the matter , I have always believed that , in all of these cases , prevention is less costly than repair .
A WHO study published in September 2000 established that , in France alone , atmospheric pollution is the cause each year of 31 700 deaths , 500 000 asthma attacks and 25 000 cases of bronchitis , and has an economic impact equal to 1.7 % of GDP .
In 96 % of cases , the causes are attributable to man , and that is why the Spanish Government has announced a series of measures , including stiffer penalties for this crime and a ban on building in the areas in question .
Ladies and gentlemen , with regard to the matter of the budget and the funding earmarked for the meeting of young people with the Pope in Cologne , I should like to make it clear that if anyone else managed to bring together so many young people for a good cause , I would certainly vote in favour of providing funding for the meeting .
Not only is Rien Parlevliet seriously ill , and Li Yang and Eddy Tang , both from Rotterdam , are in a bad way , but I should also , and particularly , like to again highlight the cause of Machiel Kuijt .
In conclusion , I should like to say that as the House defends the cause of Belarus today , it is also defending European solidarity and honour .
Even more importantly , the failure of Sinn Féin ’ s leadership to ensure that justice is done in this case undermines the cause of Irish Republicanism .
The possibility of carrying out a post -incident technical investigation to ascertain the causes of the incident and those responsible should therefore be reviewed , and this case should also be considered within the Erika II policy package , so that it can genuinely be said that those responsible for carrying out the checks will themselves be checked .
The extent of the suspected irregularities is cause for concern , but far worse is the fact that the Commission , by its own admission , does not really know what kind of irregularities these are , and consequently does not know either what is recoverable or how it may be recovered – and this in as many as 90 % of cases .
Of all the information , audits and about nine hundred sampled transactions the Court looked at in 2005 , in only four cases did the Court have cause to suspect fraud or serious violation of the rules and regulations and inform the European anti-fraud office ( OLAF ) .
In my political life I have not been afraid to take on impossible causes and tilt at windmills and run into brick walls , but I think that if we did attempt some kind of harmonisation of this area , what we would end up with , if anything , would be the most illiberal piece of legislation ever to go through any House anywhere in the world , because it is not possible .
A letter was written by Elena Bonner , the widow of Andrei Sakharov , to Nicholas Bethel &apos; s family a few days ago , in which she recognised that , without his help , the cause of Sakharov and many other dissidents in the then Soviet Union - and the nature of the repressive regime - would not have been properly recognised outside .
In the case constituting the immediate cause for this debate , the products in question are toys from China .
Similarly , calling our Foreign Minister the &apos; High Representative &apos; is no grave cause for concern , but a High Representative who is merely a puppet of the Council certainly would be .
The case underlying your resolution gives us cause for the greatest concern . A young woman was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months &apos; imprisonment after being gang - raped by seven men .
The unjustified period of time , sometimes amounting to several years , which the Commission takes to prepare its response in cases of negligence on the part of Member States gives cause for concern , as do the numerous cases of Member States &apos; failure to comply with judgments of the Court of Justice .
It is a cause of deep regret for me that we have to do this but , unfortunately , that is the case .
Of the 75 activists imprisoned six years ago , whose cause has been backed by organisations including the EU , 54 remain behind bars .
However , we must also not use these stimulus measures for longer than necessary because , in that case , we would be repeating the conditions that led to the bubbles and imbalances which were the cause of this crisis .
It is , however , unacceptable to use this cause in order to force the introduction of fundamental and non-negotiable human values , as is the case with the right to life .
We are in a period when we are debating , and will debate a great deal more , a series of legislative proposals in the field of energy , and we often tend to concentrate too much on the large - scale projects and networks , forgetting other causes in which intervention is absolutely essential .
The EU certainly must not fail to honour its commitment to the cause of democracy and human rights .
Moreover , the public prosecutor not only sought to withhold knowledge of the charge from Mr Brok on spurious and highly derogatory grounds for no due cause , but made sure that the case received great publicity in the media , thus inflicting the maximum amount of damage on the Member concerned .
Their cause has been helped by several notorious cases of breaches of human rights .
For many , resisting the dam is a lost cause .
Drawing attention to another cause of resentment , Time magazine cites a former presidential aide , attorney Fred Dutton , who says : “ Lawyers are paid to complicate , to keep a dispute alive , to make everything technical . ”
Note also that in the previous verses kings were counseled not to drink wine or intoxicating liquor when officiating , lest they “ forget what is decreed and pervert the cause of any of the sons of affliction . ” — Proverbs 31 : 4 , 5 .
The next verse Pr 31 : 5 explains : “ That one may not drink and forget what is decreed and pervert the cause of any of the sons of affliction . ”

It is , after all , a matter of civilisation , progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community .
Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights , principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation : I am thinking of fair trials , and more particularly of the rights of the defence , of the impartiality and integrity of judges , of the length of legal proceedings , for which my country , Italy , unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down , of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights .
My congratulations , Mr President - in - Office , for making this issue topical once again without rejecting social cohesion and values which we hold to be fundamental , because they are not only at the heart of the founding project of the EU , but they are at the heart of our civilisation and , above all , of our understanding of the need for solidarity between all Europeans .
The universality of human rights shows that the degree to which they are applied has become a measure of progress , civilisation and culture in politics and society .
The English sage , Francis Bacon , said that knowledge is power , so knowledge of the basic languages from which our modern European languages derive improves our general knowledge and reinforces European civilisation , which , besides its humanitarian value , is also a weapon for our survival and prosperity as Europeans in a globalised economy .
These essential values of our European civilisation form the inalienable foundation for our joint actions , present and future .
I believe that it is our responsibility to set the limits , or take on board the risk of setting the limits , of successive approximations without trying to impose any ethical principles - in the case of those who have any - or principles of civilisation .
This arises partly from fear and partly from a well - established tradition , which , it must be said , is one of the negative aspects of European civilisation and one of the main causes of unrest , both civil and between nations .
. ( FR ) The rather bureaucratic term &apos; outermost regions &apos; encompasses women and men from New Caledonia , Guadeloupe , Martinique , French Guiana , Reunion , Mayotte , Saint Pierre and Miquelon , Polynesia , Wallis and Futuna and all our territories in the Pacific , the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic , which form a bridge of intelligence , solidarity and beauty between Europe and other continents and other civilisations .

I think that Spain and Morocco have done a great deal in order to avoid what many see as unavoidable , namely the clash of civilisations , the conflict when different cultures collide .
As some of you have already stated , I would , on behalf of the Council , like to underline that it would be a terrible mistake to view the events of the past week as a kind of conflict between two civilisations , or worse , a conflict between philosophical - religious world visions .
Madam President , to continue on the same theme , in the wake of the events of 11 September , Parliament gained a very broad consensus on the need to quash any equation of Islam with terrorism , substantiating the unacceptable and dangerous theory that this is a clash of civilisations .
Every Member of this House is aware that we had a very broad consensus on avoiding the risks of an equation of Islam with terrorism and condemning anything that could be seen to be a war between civilisations .
Those who claimed to forbid any value judgments on civilisations are suddenly waging war on Islam .
It seems to me that we dilute the integrity of our argument if we give the impression that somehow different civilisations have fundamentally different approaches to human rights .
The twentieth century bore witness to the most horrendous crimes committed in the name of racist doctrines which , we should bear in mind , took place in Europe , whose civilisation was the birthplace of the great declarations on rights .
We have decided to adopt a voluntaristic policy vis -à-vis the Arab - Muslim world and we are united with many to give out the same message , namely that the crisis that has broken out and the fight against international terrorism can in no way be considered a war between civilisations .
However , we would be wronging Turkey if we did not make things absolutely clear to her - being clear , not hypocritical - and being clear means telling her that a great deal remains to be done in terms of democratic civilisation and behaviour , and that means reforms .
Even before those terrible events President Khatami launched a very useful initiative in the UN for a Dialogue between Civilisations .
I hope that they will also bring restoration , throughout the Mediterranean region , of this dimension of understanding and mutual respect which , once the difficult phase of decolonisation has been completed and the wounds accompanying this stage have begun to heal , must restore to the Mediterranean that sense of Mare Nostrum , that sense that we have of sharing with our colleagues values which are the basis of our civilisation .
I would also add that above and beyond the Treaty this cooperation is one of the ways of fostering dialogue between civilisations .
After all , it should be clear to everyone that India is certainly not experiencing a clash of civilisations .
A broad international coalition must be built and must include Arab countries if we are to convince world opinion that we are not seeking a clash of civilisations .
They go right to the heart of the issue of compliance with the United Nations and the whole issue of the justification for military action - an issue which was widely debated during the campaign in Kosovo and a question which goes to the heart of the matter we have debated on many occasions in this Chamber - the so - called clash of civilisations .
In fact , it will put us into the hands of those who truly advocate the clash of civilisations and an attack on this basis would give an excellent boost to international terrorism .
We defend public ownership and administration of the basic sectors of the economy , both in our own country and in every country of the world , and we are fighting for a quality public health service and state education and for the unimpeded development of civilisation , with respect for each nation &apos; s individual characteristics .
There are two important texts , the &apos; Tomb of Pericles &apos; and the &apos; Oath of Alexander the Great &apos; ; what a good idea it would be to have them translated into all the languages , including the new languages of the European Union , as statements of principles , values and civilisation .
I fear that our cultures , our identities and our specific character , which has , moreover , given birth to world civilisations , might suffer the same fate .
Not only is this crisis taking place at the Union &apos; s southern borders and destabilising the whole of the Middle East and the Mediterranean region , but it also has wider adverse repercussions affecting the dialogue between civilisations and religions and the fight against international terrorism .
I hope that the proper application of this regulation , together with other supporting policies to develop and democratise the countries of origin of illegal immigrants , will significantly improve the deeper social and political problem which affects our societies and provides a breeding ground for a climate of racism and xenophobia which is an insult to the humanitarian and democratic values of European political and social civilisation .
Under these circumstances , talk of dialogue between civilisations sounds ridiculous and we wonder what purpose the proposed parliamentary conference will serve .
I would like to point out that , on that occasion , the creation of the Euro - Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly was formalised , we agreed to set up the Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations and we provided for a substantial increase in the EIB ’ s Euro - Mediterranean Facility , all in the anticipation and hope of a genuine Euro - Mediterranean Bank being set up handling capital from the countries of the African continent too .
It will not become a new civilisation , however , whilst the ayatollahs continue to abuse their unrestricted power , but will instead be doomed to remain an international pariah .
Regardless of the decision taken , it is incumbent on us to prove to the Islamic world that we do not set our borders according to the clash of civilisations some are determined to bring about .
Instead of containing terror , they have made it stronger and more dangerous ; they have spread hatred of the West throughout the Islamic world and are in danger of embroiling the world in a clash of civilisations , which is the most fertile soil for fundamentalism .
This is not just about Iraq , it is about the stability of the entire region , which will determine whether there is to be a ‘ clash of civilisations ’ , and whether we can prevent the great war between the cultures .
The EU ’ s previous enlargement to include countries of former eastern Europe is open to criticism as regards it s timescale or some of the modalities involved , but nobody challenges the principle that those eastern European countries belong to the common European civilisation .
On the other hand , it is worth noting what we still lack in order to have peace as an objective and as a tool with which to resolve political conflicts throughout the world and to achieve true multipolarism as rapidly as possible , with a view to combating the clash between civilisations that is the fruit of preventive war and of terrorism .
There is a reason for Turkey ’ s countless problems , and that reason is a civilisation that has damaging effects upon the development of society .
To reject them would mean thwarting the efforts that Turkey is making to modernise itself and to develop a democratic system ; it would mean consigning that country to the confusion and despotism of unstable regions such as the Middle East and the Caucasus ; and it would mean sending out a negative signal to the whole moderate Islamic world , reinforcing the intransigence of the fundamentalists and lending support to those who predict a clash of civilisations .
It is an unfortunate fact that altruism by employers towards their employees has not to date been a founding principle of our civilisation .
There is a further principle that I believe must be highlighted , and that is that no one can be suspected of terrorism on the basis of ethnicity or religious belief , because that would genuinely mean the victory of terrorism , which relies on conflict between religions and civilisations .
It is on that basis that we have to respond to the apparent clash of civilisations , and each of us has problems with fundamentalists .
I believe that , on the eve of the United Nations Assembly , it is important for us to jointly defend the alliance of civilisations .
The fact that Israeli public opinion is in favour of the evacuation , and clearly opposed to anti-Arab attacks , can be taken as evidence that the modern world is not condemned to a clash of civilisations or to the victory of fundamentalist philosophies .
Mr President , China is a great nation and has been a great civilisation , but it s name and standing are diminished by its human rights abuses .

The press asked us questions such as , ‘ Is it Islam versus the West , or perhaps a clash of civilisations ? ’ .
The European Union has a credibility problem , a problem with double standards , and this is something we have to consider in the present situation with these caricatures and what is claimed to be a clash of civilisations .
And no , it is not a clash between religions or civilisations .
We are not faced with a clash of civilisations , but rather with a different attitude towards human rights , freedom and democracy .
Christian , orthodox and islamic civilisations lived in peaceful coexistence in Bosnia and Hercegovina .
In my view , it is based on a misunderstanding of the way in which economies – and , for that matter , human civilisations – develop in the course of history .
In his valedictory lecture , former President Khatami appealed for a dialogue of civilisations , a dialogue of religions .
If we choose to call them &apos; our &apos; values rather than treating them as universal values , I think we will fall into the trap of the &apos; clash of civilisations &apos; .
Therefore , please let us not restrict the debate to this group alone : it is much broader , and it is very important that we not only respect different religions and civilisations , but also that we work with each other , talk to each other and have an ongoing dialogue .
I feel that the new Europe is based on ideas of tolerance , dialogue and mutual understanding between civilisations , without losing sight of the great achievements of our continent .
Europe is traditions , a civilisation , but it is also the adaptation to new realities ; it is a certain idea of globalisation , of the reforms aimed at creating a fairer society .
Terrorism nowadays is closely associated with the symmetrical political principles which promote the clash of civilisations and war , and on that point your silence is deafening .
Those who dare not say that , and thus will certainly not dare to carry it out , will create enormous problems that will eventually cost our prosperity and our civilisation dear .
This is a great civilisation and one that is closely related to our own .
From the outset , having to liaise with other groups has allowed me to clarify that this resolution in no way intends to rekindle conflict between civilisations .
In terms of the EU &apos; s external relations , we call for dialogue and not a clash between civilisations .
Personally I am not convinced that a clash of civilisations is underway .
Our continents share a common civilisation and a past .
With the Middle East conflict , we are little by little entering very dangerous territory , that of the clash of civilisations .
Europe has an historic responsibility , that of urgently strengthening the dialogue between civilisations .
Not only the Alpine region , but all our countries are involved : the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat .
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation .
The Union can not be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values , whether it comes down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand , it has a greater ambition : the desire to be a supranational union , in ways that have yet to be defined , that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world .
Today , we have been called on to choose , for the forthcoming decades , between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy , but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring .
I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations , many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today .
Mr Prime Minister , we would like to believe , along with you and the Portuguese Presidency , that Europe should be built as a civilisation whose economic and social prosperity is founded on the cultivation of knowledge , cultural diversity and cohesion , and which plays an active role in promoting a world order that is more balanced , more peaceful , and less fragmented .
In this way , Europe can make a substantial contribution to progress , progress of civilisation .
I must protest about the use by the United States of America of the death penalty on an almost industrial scale . This is the most powerful country in the world which claims to embody the cutting edge of civilisation .
As a result of that 500 year - old meeting of civilisations , Mexico is a country culturally and politically bound to Europe .
It is about a battle between civilisation and barbarism .
It is not a question of restricting that freedom but , on the contrary , of becoming aware that man lives within a family and national community , that his humanity imposes rules on him , failing which civilisation becomes synonymous with barbarism .
Thirdly and most importantly , we are considering an issue which is at the very root of our civilisation .
Christianity has taught us the value of the dignity of every human being ; the tradition of the left enshrines the concept that the human person , man , is not a commodity and can not be treated as such . Well , we are now clearly running the risk of turning human beings into commodities , at least in part , and this affects the very roots of our civilisation - in terms of Christianity and also of the enlightenment and Marxism .
There &apos; s the rub : do we or do we not have the courage to tackle these taboo areas at the very time when we are starting to see such promising beginnings of a new phase in human civilisation ?
That unanimity is reassuring , because all the signatories to this resolution are in agreement on the essential point . That has happened because we all now know that the essential point is a certain concept of humanity , relations between peoples , values - in short , civilisation , the heart of Europe &apos; s identity .
That is also one of the great principles of Western civilisation !
. ( FR ) In any civilisation , asylum is a concrete example of charity towards those who , for many reasons , find themselves in difficulty , and nobody is contesting the validity of giving aid to those who are victims .
At the dawn of the third millennium , more or less regular trials are still ending with the sentence of corporal punishment , and this does not seem worthy of either democracy or the civilisation of the third millennium .
Contrary to what is assumed in recitals B and C , Saddam Hussein , a latter - day Nebuchadnesar , took it upon himself to raze this old civilisation he admired so much to the ground .
Will the Middle East be a black coalition of Khomenei mullahs in Iran , Shiites in Iraq , Muslim brothers in Jordan , Hezbollah in Lebanon , Hammas in the Occupied Territories and Islamic fundamentalist organisations in North Africa or will it be a coalition of peace , oriented towards Europe and Western civilisation , consisting of Egypt as the linchpin of the peace , Jordan , Palestine as a state - I will come back to that in a minute - the state of Israel , Syria , Lebanon , Turkey and the rest of the world ?
Civilisation and humanity show their character most clearly in the way in which they treat life when it is defenceless .
The great philosopher Nietzsche , however , warned us that it is impossible to found a civilisation on knowledge .
This is the model of European civilisation which , after centuries of bloody conflict , has guaranteed us lasting peace between our peoples , and it is this peace and this social model which is our gift to the candidate countries , whom we do not ask to share our traditions or beliefs but to accept the same rules as we do in order to safeguard the freedom and dignity of every human being .
We should certainly not wish to give some false impression that we were in some way hostile to these nations that belong to our family , these nations that are European in terms of their peoples , languages and geography , that are Christian by faith and Western by civilisation , and , we hope , immune to all modern forms of totalitarianism , including those that are now approaching , after decades of terrible suffering .
The civilisation we share asserts its greatness through respect for the rules of an open , tolerant and liberal society , with its inclusive and multicultural dynamics .
Modern civilisation is rightly offended by this unregulated trade in death .
Due to its uniqueness , Europe has nothing to fear from any other cultural entity : its light only fades when its historical and cultural identity grows faint , when we behave as if our civilisation is only held together by economic and commercial ties .
If Europe wants to be something more than merely the scene of the globalisation battle , if it wants to be a complete Community , moving , united in all its components and expressions , towards new progress and new civilisation , we call upon you , not to give us more than the others but to allow us to be citizens on an equal footing with the others .
I therefore propose , Commissioner , that you consider the possibility of Europe establishing a European Day of protest against the death penalty : this would make a substantial contribution to generating a universal consciousness from that cradle of civilisation which Europe is and wishes to remain .
Mr President , I believe that the institutions must live up to the values of our civilisation and that our citizens must see themselves reflected in the ethical mirror that , as a result of our work , we should be for them .
Braudel &apos; s &apos; Mediterranean of a thousand things &apos; , the ancient civilisations which , for years , have regarded each other with hostility across the Basin , now have the opportunity to start afresh , setting off along a common path which , through political will and the power of dialogue , will lay the foundations for genuine progress and economic and social development .
The European Parliament is indeed well aware that , after ten years of conflict , not everything is possible in Yugoslavia , at least not straightaway , and that urgent actions need prioritising . The Balkans , to which you belong , are on the dividing line between the great civilisations and religions which have , all too often , left their tragic mark on our common past as Europeans - on you and us alike .
Thereby Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilisation within the framework of world history , and its capacity for creative political imagination for its future development .
Perhaps the citizens of the European Union can understand that best if they evoke their historic memory and those long - past years after World War II , when the prospects for the Continent and European civilisation itself were extremely uncertain .
Mr President , the Mediterranean is the cradle of European civilisation .
Commissioner , last November , you yourself said in the French press that the objective of the Barcelona Process was both simple and ambitious , i.e. an area at peace , enjoying shared prosperity , promoting the emergence of civil society while respecting human rights and ensuring the mutual understanding of different civilisations .
Earlier on , I quoted Kofi Annan , but , in fact , the process of enlargement itself is regarded by the United Nations and by everyone as a supreme message of peace and civilisation to the whole world .
I hope that we shall reject the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market because they break with the tradition of a Parliament - as Mrs Fraisse quite rightly said - which has , until now , defended diversity in cultural production in Europe and the specific , and indeed exceptional role , of creative artists , writers and artists in European civilisation .
I have seen year after year the steady drainage , the reduction of the water , and the fact now that over half a million marsh dwellers , reaching right back beyond the beginnings of civilisation of our world , have now had their livelihood , their lives destroyed , their place removed from under their feet by the Iraqi marsh drainage .
As an admirer of the ancient civilisation of the Iraqi people , I find it hard to accept that the population has been allowed to suffer so much in the economic interests of others and been attacked both from within and without .
What action does the Commission intend to take in view of these phenomena which bring shame on our civilisation ?
The Middle East is the original home of human civilisation .
The sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are , of course , a scandal in a modern civilisation and it is unthinkable that criminal networks and customers should go unpunished and avoid criminal prosecution by taking advantage of the lack of cooperation between countries and shortcomings in our criminal legislation .
We need to focus on the causes of the mental and physical abuse and exploitation of children , such as poverty , the lack of fundamental structures to protect children , the lack of control and prevention mechanisms , the breakdown of the family and , of course , the fact that such a market - a market of huge supply and demand - exists and , unfortunately , operates within the European Union , discrediting our European civilisation .
We should not be surprised that there is no rhyme or reason to this aspect of our civilisation .
I consider this war to be making a mockery of our civilisation .
We must continue to fight to defend and extend the values of European civilisation .
We urgently need to wipe out xenophobia , fundamentalism and racial violence and to crush phenomena such as slavery , trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of women and children which stigmatise our civilisation .
This is an attack on our common values , on democracy , on the very foundations of our civilisation .
All defenders of democracy must protect our precious civilisation and uphold the civilised rule of law .
It is not in fact just the United States , but the whole of Western civilisation that has just been the victim of an act of war , of a new war , which is murderous but elusive , because it does not correspond to any traditional criteria .
Madam President , Madam President - in - Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , last week we formally expressed our sympathies for all the victims of these attacks , who came from America , Europe and the whole of the world ; we expressed our solidarity with the United States and , now , with pain but also with determination , we must respond to global terrorism , to this mixture of fanaticism and advanced technology which threatens our civilisation and our open , democratic and multicultural society .
Yesterday and this morning , Mr Solana quite rightly stressed that it is vital that our fight against terrorism is not perceived by those in the Arab and Muslim world as a war against their civilisation , or even as a crusade , to use one of the most alarming expressions of President Bush .
I believe it is especially important now for the European Parliament to state strongly once again , that this is not a clash of civilisations , but , rather , that we have to defend values that are shared by all humanity .
First of all , we must strongly condemn the age - old rumour of the purported superiority of Western civilisation and Christianity .
But rather than giving other people lessons in civilisation , we should have the intellectual integrity to describe this chapter in our history as it was : A crime against humanity .
The United Nations Conference on Racism is of particular relevance in these turbulent times , when there is bloodthirsty talk and behaviour in the name of a confrontation between civilisations .
We are witnessing armed conflicts which originate in and are sustained by racial or ethnic conflicts and we are astonished to hear statements whose content and origin are unacceptable , on the superiority of certain civilisations over others .
However , looking beyond these events , whilst we too experience this sadness and solidarity , I want to reassert our belief , and that of the Commission as a whole , that the fight against terrorism is not and can not be a clash of civilisations .
To echo Mr Poettering &apos; s concern , let me repeat what I said in my statement this morning about the fight against terrorism . That fight certainly involves all the states ; in no case can it be reduced to some kind of conflict between the different civilisations of the world .
This is not a clash of civilisations ; it is not a campaign against Islam . What we must do is to take practical action during the coming weeks and months and show the people that we genuinely wish to express our solidarity and support with more than just words .
It is absolutely right that we have to make it clear this is not a clash of civilisations .
Since we have seen how those events have led to the danger of misunderstanding between civilisations , the message which you are to address to the Europeans today is of universal and particularly topical importance .
This solution would greatly enhance the international image of China and contribute to her stability and unity -- the two topmost priorities of Beijing -- while at the same time the Tibetans would be ensured of the basic rights and freedoms to preserve their own civilisation and to protect the delicate environment of the Tibetan plateau .
Where it did not wipe them out , our so - called civilisation reduced most of them to poverty .
These days we are thinking about defending our civilisation .
Our civilisation is to do with giving people proper rights of defence and I am sad at recent developments in the United Kingdom that seem to be ending these rights .
. ( FR ) The Fiori report has represented an historic attempt by the European Union to impose the adoption of a common position with regard to something which forms the very basis of civilisations : the definition of the human being and its dignity .
By means of this vote , the European Parliament has proved that only the States can create the appropriate framework for dealing with these fundamental issues , respecting the cultural and spiritual traditions on which our civilisation is based .
Finally , it is through political courage and a clear vision of what gives the human being its dignity and greatness , that it remains possible to maintain a civilisation and a form of progress which are truly human .

The originators of the lines , members of the Nazca / Paracas civilization , although advanced in many ways , did not leave a written record .
The idea that the Nazca / Paracas civilization needed help from outer space to make these designs belittles their intelligence ( any high school student with basic knowledge of geometry could duplicate the drawings with stakes and cords ) and is not in accord with their other accomplishments .

Other civilizations , too , had monuments that were too large to be fully viewed from the ground , thus being hidden from the ordinary observer .

Though we may regret this - in that major efforts have to be made to comply with provisions which sometimes seem pernickety - we also have to accept that it is necessary , because of the extreme complexity and diversity of wine itself , the different grape varieties , different regions , different designations relating to ancestral production traditions and customs reflecting the growth of what I will unhesitatingly call &apos; the civilization of wine &apos; .
Wine , a fruit of our Mediterranean and European civilization , would , I think , have been deserving of a wider audience .

The passage in the European Council &apos; s conclusions on the organization of work and hours of work is an important step forward , which the social partners will be able to develop the search , in full autonomy , for new ways of organizing work which reconcile the creation of employment with the maintenance of the level of social protection compatible with our traditions and our civilization .
But the law is not there to serve employment and competition or even the values which represent the cement of our civilization , since the law is the very incarnation of those values of society .

So we will be left with an even more severe monetaristic logic , calling into question European civilization as such .
So if we really want to talk about a single currency associated with a positive solution to the real problems of European economies and social conditions , we need to have the courage to separate out what can be separated - in other words , the procedure for approaching the single currency - from the policies of the Maastricht Treaty , by putting on our agenda the one thing that is essential unless we really want to see the European currency achieved by bringing European civilization to its knees : the amendment and correction of the Maastricht Treaty .

Of course , this civilization has not had only good sides to it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; When civilization reigns in any country , a wider and less harassed life is afforded to the masses of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think the decline of Western civilization is inevitable , because I don &apos;t think history operates in this kind of life - cycle model , beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole &apos; s &quot; &quot; Course of Empire &quot; &quot; paintings . &quot;
Complex civilizations do that , because they operate , most of the time , on the edge of chaos .
That &apos; s one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations .
The bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power .
And I would say that we can &apos;t give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that &apos; s to give up the thing that makes civilization .

The alternative is that civilizations don &apos;t last very long , but destroy themselves .
However , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the Commission &apos; s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas .
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things . No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again .
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region . However , we already knew this .
All this does is to legitimise the development , on the European scale , of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers &apos; main claims towards the highest common denominator .
In the light of the recent agreement signed by Germany on compensation of DM 10 billion for forced labour in German industry , will the Council take steps to ensure that the victims of the fascist war are given their rightful compensation and that the loans extracted during the occupation are repaid , bearing in mind that , since the unification of Germany , not even the formal reason that Germany adduced for not settling these legitimate and valid claims now applies ?
It was on this premise and with the noble claim that it would not repeat past mistakes - the last Commission having been brought down just under a year ago as the result of fraud and irregularities - that the Prodi Commission took office in September .
The Commission must be measured against this claim and its self - evident obligation , as guardian of the Treaties vis -à-vis third parties , to guarantee that their application begins at home .
At this point in time , the claims of the Assyrian - Chaldean community basically relate to the problem of restoring monasteries and the official teaching of Aramaic and the problem connected with the free movement of citizens from this ethnic group who live outside Turkey .
Unfortunately , instead of heeding the anxiety and supporting the claims of all these classes of society , the resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference kow - tows to capitalist forces and adopts the decisions made by the monopolies to militarise Europe and intervene in third countries , including militarily , in order to limit further still the national independence and the grass - roots sovereignty of individual countries .
Turkish public opinion need have no fear of our being tempted to encourage any separatist claims whatsoever .
In this communication from the Commission , the European Union sets out its claim to impose itself as protector on the countries of South East Europe .
But throughout the century which has just ended , that region of Europe has known nothing but suffering because of that claim , whether made by rival European powers or by a Western Europe which likes to think it is united .
When I look at the petitions which have been sent to the European Parliament &apos; s Committee on Petitions because claims arising from traffic accidents in another country have taken years and years to settle , I am quite sure that this directive constitutes a very decisive step forward .

If Mr Bigliardo would like to substantiate his claim in more detail , I should be pleased to receive his letter and answer it .
It is very important that we stick to facts and avoid some of the wilder claims that have been put in the Green motion for a resolution on this issue .

The Council adopted , on 6 July 1998 , a decision on the Community &apos; s participation in the HIPC Initiative with regard to its claims , special loans and risk capital managed by the European Investment Bank for eligible ACP countries .
However , we believe that this issue of representation precedes that of security and defence and in fact lies at the level of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the well - known claims made by Parliament with regard to its involvement in this wider policy .
This point has been and is being discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference and we will see to what extent these claims are accepted .
We can not ignore , and it would be politically incorrect to so do , the gestures of openness already made by Tunisia , particularly in freeing 600 political prisoners , returning passports to certain members of the opposition and being clearly willing to reduce tensions in the case of the journalist , Taouffik Ben Brick , and accepting his specific claims .
Since the change in the right to asylum , many refugees no longer have any legal claim to asylum . It was , and remains , totally legitimate to want to live somewhere other than your place of birth .

Progress will only be made if it is agreed that it is a truly international city to which all traditions have a valid claim .

Claims of infallibility have already done Europe untold damage .
By calling for further research into gene therapy and other forms of genetic engineering , the European Parliament is treading on very thin ice , particularly as there is not a word about the risks or about unsuccessful experiments , nor are they subjected to any kind of political assessment , all of which would cast some doubt on the unreservedly positive claims being made .
Clearly , the European Union can not possibly tolerate Spanish terrorists using the construction of Europe as an alibi in order to justify their claims .
Pending a similar success in Italy - hopefully in the near future - I hope that the problems of the Slovenian pensioners and elderly people will be resolved too . I may add that it would be as well for Slovenia to withdraw all claims and cease all animosity - which , regrettably , have recently come out , here and there , in certain major statements - in respect of the Italian Republic .
The European Union also has to live up to its claim to play a leading role in this area .
The proposed resolution will not lead to the restoration of fishing rights , but , at best , to Spain and Portugal having a more solid claim to compensation subsidies .
3 . The Charter contains some lofty claims but imposes no concomitant obligation and can not therefore be enforced by the citizens of Europe .
At the same time , the Court of Auditors says that potential claims have been significantly overvalued .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union has yet to substantiate adequately its claim to exercise responsibility for peace and above all for lasting stability in the world .
Often , when we address issues of justice , we devote too much time to the penal system , to prisons , to crime - fighting forces , to criminal codes and even to the claims of those in the legal profession .

Moreover , the artist is assigned a right of information so that he can make his claims to royalties known to a professional art dealer during a period of up to three years , which is reasonable since the dealer has to keep the accounts of his purchases and sales .
Now , it is a law of nature that absolute power corrupts absolutely , and there are symptoms of such corruption , for instance : a form of economic diplomacy which might be summed up in the words , &apos; what is ours is ours and what is yours is negotiable &apos; , the claim of establishing a new world order , a pax Americana whose influence is far from that of always promoting peace , and the unacceptable development of unqualified interference in the internal affairs of other States .

On the other hand , if they go to Wikipedia , they &apos; ll find a genuine article -- and I won &apos;t talk a lot about Wikipedia , because Jimmy Wales is here -- but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica , differently written , including the controversies over body image and commercialization , the claims about the way in which she &apos; s a good role model , etc .
I &apos; m sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world , and that it &apos; s very important that we build it properly .

Secondly , and most importantly , they all began their sporting careers in an amateur club or at a school .
Who has not been concerned at the plans of certain private groups to create their own sports competitions , outside the jurisdiction of the national and international federations and on the basis of a single criterion , namely the size of the participating clubs &apos; budgets , as we have recently seen in association football and , subsequently , in basketball too ?
Sports federations and governments should be able , if they so wish , to take appropriate measures to protect the clubs that develop young talent .
At the same time , the international sports authorities have a responsibility to take action to control club management in order to avoid excesses , especially in relation to transfers .
The Commission recognises the specific nature of sport in the sense that some degree of equality is needed in competition between players and clubs so as to guarantee the uncertainty of results , which is the very essence of sport , as the Minister has just emphasised .
We have made the point that , under national codes of employment legislation , some form of compensation is warranted when a player breaks his contract with one club in order to join another .
The specific status of sport derives primarily from the sports system , from the social pyramid which is reflected in the structure of small clubs in our towns and rural areas as well as in major sporting events .
FIFA has certainly been very slow to act and should be criticised for that , but the Commissioner must also be prepared to listen to the small clubs , the players &apos; organisations , and spectators .
This means that insufficient account has been taken of the special hallmarks of sport and its 700 000 clubs , and of voluntary work done in areas like youth work and training for children and young people .
The European Commission is questioning the system of transfers between clubs , believing it to be contrary to players &apos; freedom of movement . But the Commission is totally ignoring the distortion of competition between Member States , the social and fiscal disparity among professional sportsmen , which encourages the best of them to migrate to certain countries .
Not only do the agents charge the players ; they are also paid by the clubs , from which they extract commission , and I have first - hand knowledge of this .
Because we are all concerned about the excesses that occur in sport , it is very understandable that we have been focusing on those excesses , but it must also be stressed that the vast majority of the men and women who are involved in sport - participants and voluntary officials in local sports clubs and in sports associations - are men and women with a high regard for the values of sport , advocates of the sporting ethic who want sport to be a means of individual and collective development .
In the past 48 hours , FIFA has made some extremely constructive and interesting proposals , which , if adopted , would serve to protect the youth - development system and individual rights , as well as satisfying the clubs &apos; need to build and train teams .
It is vital , however , that some of the major clubs which seek complete deregulation , so that they can organise private competitions , do not try to sabotage the discussion process on which FIFA and the Commission are about to embark .
I would also add , in the same vein , that we must accord due respect for the small clubs and their countless voluntary workers who give sport a real civic dimension .
It is from that manipulated world that we must protect real sport , the amateur sport practised in thousands of clubs , which have limited resources and survive thanks only to the devotion , ability and generosity of a huge number of voluntary workers .
Special attention must be paid to the system of player transfers and the protection of young sportsmen and women , the role of national sports federations , club ownership , television rights , sport &apos; s civic work and ethical principles .
Why should we allow the basic fabric of training within the rich tapestry of sports clubs and associations to be abused ?

The second component involves encouraging and compensating the effort made by clubs to train young people , thereby giving their sports activities a social dimension , which , moreover , is a characteristic of the European dimension of sport .
We are convinced , then , that it is possible to find a balance between a player &apos; s mobility and the necessary compensation of the training club within the limits laid down by the Court in the Bosman case .
Secondly , the imposition of disciplinary measures on players and clubs who terminate their contracts during it s first two seasons without just cause or valid reasons .

I should like to mention something which was said on the BBC by someone who is not a football referee like you but who is the coach of the England team .
When a person other than the sportsman or woman has taken part , such as a club , an association , a federation , a doctor , a coach , etc . , that person should also be subject to a penalty , exactly equal to that given to the sportsman or woman , because we should not forget that the person with the shortest working life will always be the sportsman or woman .
Too many athletes and coaches either do not understand this or knowingly take the risk .
The coach has put his team together in consultation with the management , in the full knowledge that each member of that management was allowed to designate one player .
Some players have weaknesses , but all of them have enough experience on the field , have promised fair play and have accepted the authority of the coach and all of them realise that it will be an important match .
For those who may not be positioned correctly , additional man cover has been provided , and the coach can change people around at any time and , if necessary , send them off the pitch .
With that coach we have already agreed to play , and we are indeed counting on him to turn this team of twenty - four into a cohesive team and to ensure that it will end up in a higher division than last season .
Finally the striker is alone in the box , he passes the goalkeeper and he is just about to put the ball into the empty goal when suddenly the coach shouts &apos; stop , turn round and bring the ball back &apos; !

It is not only sporting achievements that are important but also health and educational work with young people , to which coaches in clubs should also devote a great deal of attention .
If players fail to score , their coach does not go and widen the goal , but instead sees to it that they play better .
The matter merely involved a football team which , like 31 others - or rather 30 others - is going to lose or has already lost , and a coach who had refused to shake hands with his South African counterpart , much like a president who refuses to shake hands with his fellow citizens .
Therefore , we have to keep a sense of pragmatism alongside the vision , and be aware that what we are doing is like the work of a good football coach : it will not be judged on the basis of carefully thought -out and theoretically irreproachable game plans , but purely and simply on results .
Our team has been well prepared by the coach , Yves Thibault de Silguy , but the supporters in the stands , in other words , public opinion , as represented by the Members of the European Parliament and those of national parliaments , are anxious .
Both said that they suffered from mistreatment by their coach back in Congo each time they lost a competition .
But before the season started , coach Lombardi took me aside .
The coaches emphasized the need to be rough , and being exceptionally strong , I became highly skilled at beating my opponent .
The coaches later asked me why I didn ’ t .
The reality of what it now takes to win in the Olympics was noted by one coach who said : “ A country has to hire professionals if it wants to win in amateur sports . ”
Coaches show high school and college teams violent films to psyche them for opponents . ”
I played that way because everyone — coaches , fans , media — seemed to expect it from me . ”
The coaches are often employed by business tycoons who want their franchises to flourish financially .
So the coaches are driven to satisfy the public demand .
Then why do parents and coaches put so much pressure on the kids ?
But when I saw the coach putting pressure on the kids I told him I was withdrawing my son .
They would appoint Chis , the athletic coach , as principal of the school .
Chis was well liked in spite of his alcoholism , and while he was coach the school never lost a game .
“ For all three , the most difficult tradeoff was moving away from their homes before the age of 15 , to be able to work with a coach whose training ability was good enough to push them to their potential . ”
One year ago a top - ranking athlete and highly respected sports coach was baptized in Helsinki , Finland .
My coach had found a job in the NHL and wanted me to play for his new team , the Colorado Rockies .
My coach in Cleveland and Colorado had himself in the off - season gone to Pittsburgh and now traded for me .
High - school athletes aspiring to be stars in the sports world , their coaches , and possibly their parents know that a few more pounds , a few more muscles in the right places may mean the difference between stardom and mediocrity .
With handsome six - and seven - figure salaries being paid those reaching star status and fame for the schools and colleges and their coaches , plus the glory it will bring to their parents , the pressure is on for the would - be star to get the jump on his competition by turning to steroids .
One noted expert on physical education claims that high - school athletes have the backing of both parents and coaches for steroid use .
There , profanity is sometimes deliberately promoted by team coaches .
The athletes ’ coaches are usually party to the doping ; they may even be the ones who recommend it .
Former East German coach Winfried Heinicke admits : “ I told them if you want to go to the Olympics , you ’ ll have to do this &#91; take drugs &#93; . ”
However , the most insistent coach persuaded my father to grant me a week ’ s leave to compete in a difficult race in the Pyrenees mountain range along the French - Spanish border .
But my coach and a sports journalist convinced my father that I was one of France ’ s bicycle - racing hopes , so he let me go .
People revealed this when it said : “ As skaters , coaches and officials privately mourn the deaths of their friends , they remain confused and fearful about dealing publicly with AIDS and with the issue of homosexuality in skating . ”
“ This was reflected in the somber groups of players and coaches who gathered to discuss the issue at practices today . ”
Jon , a former high school football player , recalls : “ We had this coach who was a real maniac ; always screaming and yelling at us ...
While not all coaches are abusive , many do place too much stress on winning .
Another harsh reality : Coaches often put players under tremendous pressure to injure their opponents .
Or so many athletes , coaches and sports fans believe . ”
Pressure from teachers , coaches , and parents can add to the frustration .
“ We had this coach who was a real maniac ; always screaming and yelling at us ...
All too often , coaches stress winning — even if it means causing injury to others
The game ends in a brawl , with more than 100 parents , coaches , and players shouting and throwing punches after an overtime touchdown wins the game .
When a ten - year - old player drops a pass , his coach throws him to the ground , breaking both of his arms .
The boy ’ s father threatens to kill the coach and is sentenced to 45 days in jail .
It is the violence of parents and coaches who would rather fight than lose .
Not surprisingly , the rage of parents and overzealous coaches often filters down to the young athletes themselves .
The coaches provided a thorough assessment of the women ’ s pure athletic abilities .
As it turned out , the women ’ s measure of hope was a far more accurate predictor of their performance than were all the statistics evaluated by their coaches .
As her coach , I noticed that she had an interest in spiritual things .
The coach has to help them develop their strengths and minimize their weaknesses .
However , to the disappointment of her coach , teammates , and herself , she ran the worst race of her career .
“ My coach tried to push me to do harder workouts and warned me , but I did not listen . ”
&quot; I can remember speaking to a 12 - year - old boy , a football player , and I asked him , I said , &quot; &quot; How would you feel if , in front of all the players , your coach told you you were playing like a girl ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
With profound simplicity , Coach John Wooden redefines success and urges us all to pursue the best in ourselves . In this inspiring talk he shares the advice he gave his players at UCLA , quotes poetry and remembers his father &apos; s wisdom .
And I did know how the alumni of various schools back in the 30s judged coaches and athletic teams .
Not like the coaches today , for gracious sakes , no .
I liked our -- as a basketball coach at UCLA I liked our practices to be the journey , and the game would be the end . The end result .
&quot; No one said , &quot; &quot; Get him a coach in speaking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what I did , which is going from 21 strokes per 20 - yard length to 11 strokes in two workouts with no coach , no video monitoring .
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown .
&quot; I went to my coach : &quot; &quot; Please , don &apos;t make me do this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; And don &apos;t tell me it &apos; s from the guys and the coaches and the dads , because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr President , a rather serious problem arose this morning when the assistants were suddenly prevented from boarding the coach to bring us here from the Hotel Monopol , despite the fact that this practice has been applied without a hitch for the past 21 years .
I should like to protest because there would have been five members in the coach and the assistants would have been late for work .
As you no doubt recall , this proposal for a directive on the construction of buses and coaches gave rise to lengthy and involved debates at first reading .
When the Albanian minority of a town such as that of Tetovo sees coach loads of workers , &apos; ethnic Macedonian &apos; workers , arriving from Skopje , the only possible conclusion is that they are being treated differently .
The proposed directive , as well as protecting children in cars , will help to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries resulting from accidents in coaches , minibuses and lorries , by making the use of safety belts compulsory for drivers and passengers when those safety belts are supplied .
I should like to stress that , with this directive , the European Community will be setting the pace and enabling the industry to compete under common rules to produce safe and more accessible buses and coaches for the benefit of all European public transport users .
The access provisions for buses and coaches as regards boarding by persons with reduced mobility will ensure that a larger proportion of our citizens use public transport .
Mr President , Mr Hatzidakis &apos; report is on the dimensions of road vehicles , including motor coaches .
As you know , pensioners and elderly people , who enjoy a spot of sightseeing and visiting the beautiful cities of Europe when they are in good health , often travel by coach .
As I said just now , where they are still able to do so , a great many pensioners travel by bus or coach out of necessity or to go sightseeing .
It is equally true to say that it was one of the first countries to fit speed limiters on coaches , for obvious reasons .
Recommendation for second reading ( A5-0235 / 2002 ) by Dana Scallon , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the INTERBUS Agreement on the international occasional carriage of passengers by coach and bus ( 13262 / 1 / 2001 - COM ( 2001 ) 540 - C5-0087 / 2002 - 2001 / 0242 ( AVC ) )
As shown by the people in the visitors &apos; galleries , bus and coach travel is on the increase , as people make more journeys with them , and so we have to do more to make it safer .
The second aspect of safety that we have to get to grips with is the requirement to fit seatbelts , which at present applies only to new coaches .
We can not wait ten or 15 years for coaches to be replaced by new ones .
We have to take action now and make use of all the technical possibilities offered by present - day coaches .
Mr President , apart from the accidents in France and Hungary , we also had a terrible accident in Greece just after Easter , in which 21 pupils lost their lives in Tembi , between Thessaloniki and Larissa , while they were on a school trip in a coach .
If the bulk of people have to wear a seatbelt in a coach but those at the back , in a so - called cosy corner , do not have to wear one , it simply does not make sense .
I therefore agree with adopting most of the measures that were proposed and with applying them to minibuses , buses and coaches and to light , medium and heavy - duty vehicles .
At a time , however , when the road mortality rate remains high , safety measures for all vehicles must be stepped up – not only for light vehicles ( category M1 ) , but also for minibuses and coaches ( categories M2 and M3 ) and light and heavy trucks ( categories N1 , N2 and N3 ) .
We are talking , in particular , about minibuses , coaches and light , medium and heavy - duty trucks .
The Commission also proposes regulating access to driving the most powerful motorbikes on a progressive basis , doing the same for HGVs and the most powerful coaches , harmonising the frequency of medical examinations for professional drivers and introducing minimum requirements for initial qualification and continuous training for driving licence examiners .
In my capacity as a Member of the Transport Committee , I 100 % support the Koch report which seeks to make it compulsory for all vehicles – minibuses , buses , coaches , light commercial vehicles and lorries – to be equipped with seat anchorages and head restraints .
Should buses and coaches be the first category to be charged ?
500 million Europeans travelled by coach in 2005 , many of them elderly people .
A year ago , a group of people who are commonly termed ‘ mad ’ came here to Strasbourg from Rome in a coach , together with mental health workers and family members .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the Harbour report , on which we voted at second reading today , deserves this House &apos; s wholehearted support , for , today , the green light was given for a type approval which will apply to such vehicles as buses , coaches and lorries in addition to cars .
Furthermore , the introduction of this framework directive will also benefit safety , partly because this is likely to accelerate the entry into effect of a number of safety measures for buses and coaches .
With regard to passengers &apos; rights , we have , thanks to Parliament , begun to introduce rights for passengers with reduced mobility in all modes of transport , particularly by coach and by sea .
Finally , as regards the issue of the 12 days , I remember the former amendment 102 in Mrs. Ţicău &apos; s report , which refers to the reintroduction of the so - called 12 - day derogation in the case of coaches .
Therefore , tomorrow , we would be very much in favour of postponing by a month acceptance of the report that contains the part about coaches and deal with it later , in June , when it is fully ready .
in writing . - ( PT ) The general aim of the proposal presented by the European Commission is to continue the EU- wide liberalisation of scheduled and occasional coach and bus services - in particular between the various countries within the EU and between these and third countries , including cabotage operations - as from 1 January 2009 .
I should also like to thank the Council and the Commission for supporting us in the end on the reintroduction of the 12 - day rule for buses and coaches .
It must be understood that there are many people , particularly older people , who do not like flying but would still like to travel as tourists in Europe and perhaps enjoy the sun in places such as Italy or Spain , hence the importance of our reintroducing the 12 - day rule for buses and coaches and making it affordable and thus possible for senior citizens to travel .
As regards the rights of bus and coach passengers , I should like to point out that there are real differences between intercity and urban buses that must be taken into account .
In the field of bus , coach and maritime transport , for which we are now laying down rules , we may encounter problems assigning responsibilities when it comes to maritime transport and the ports - but this must be given a practice - based solution in future .
Now , for the first time , we will have a set of basic rights for bus , coach and ferry users that will ensure proper liability for cancellation and delays , lost or damaged luggage , as well as death in the event of accidents .
The place for information on passenger rights is at the ticket counters themselves , or on board the buses , coaches , aeroplanes and similar modes of transport themselves .
The Teychenné report deserves my full support because it reinforces the regulatory framework not only for bus and coach passengers , but also for passengers in an area dear to me , namely sea and inland waterway passengers .
We were concerned - and this is also very important - about protecting passengers &apos; rights ; above all , we wanted to ensure that people with restricted mobility and with disabilities can always make use of transport , including buses and coaches .
I would very much like to see some sort of agreement reached during the forthcoming mediation process , because I agree absolutely with Mr Simpson when he says that the exclusion of buses and coaches is unacceptable , given that other means of transport are covered by the regulation .
At Brussels airport , we are asked , sometimes some of us are even ordered , to get onto and get off an interior transport coach twice , when obstacles such as doors should simply be avoided and passengers not hassled by being made to get on and get off .
In addition , the clause on major natural disasters , which does not apply to air travel , because damages had to be paid in the case of the ash cloud , has been applied to buses and coaches . This means that poorer passengers in particular who are making short journeys will not be compensated and have no rights .
I was particularly disappointed when a restriction was placed on the formats used to make information available about bus and coach travel .
( PL ) Madam President , today , the European Parliament is sending out a very positive message to passengers , taxpayers and European voters who use buses and coaches , including disabled persons .
If you travel from Brussels to Amsterdam by air , you are covered ; if you travel by coach , you are not .
The railway companies pay track access charges for every kilometre travelled , but the same system does not apply to buses and coaches , which benefits bus companies .
I hope the House will join me in agreeing that Britain is leading the way in Europe , not least in ensuring a level playing field with the removal of state aids but also the fitting of seat belts in coaches and mini- buses and safety at sea .
I welcome the inclusion of seat - belts because this is a very necessary safety measure for buses and coaches within the European Union .
Mr President , the proposal for a Council Directive on roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers was submitted for two principal reasons . Firstly , the inclusion of checks on speedlimitation devices installed in lorries and coaches in roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers .
In this Parliament , whether we are dealing with the buses and coaches directive , the lift directive or all the issues concerned with the information society , we have to fight and fight to get the Commission to consider disabled people &apos; s interest and to consult with disabled people at the outset of legislation .
The subject of working and rest hours for drivers of lorries , buses , and coaches , which are nowadays inundating Europe , does not seem to have been taken seriously .
Obviously there is some inconsistency here : the Commission quite rightly is planning to tackle the appalling toll of road accidents across our continent - 50 , 000 lives are lost each year - and yet at the same time the powers we already have to prevent accidents involving coaches , lorries and buses are clearly not being enforced throughout the European Union .
I dream of the day when a coach can travel through France from Britain to Bordeaux , picking up and dropping off passengers in Paris en route .
Such a move would make a reality of the single market in road transport for buses and coaches , encourage more people to use such transport and ensure a real value to a people &apos; s Europe of which we all talk .
With regard to international bus transport , the common position takes up most of the refinements recommended by the Commission and Parliament at an earlier stage , and it also incorporates the proposed introduction of a Community licence for coaches .
We are also proceeding with legislation that will provide much greater security against injury caused in the course of roll - over of coaches .
Yesterday evening a group of visitors was attacked when they were getting off the coach in Molsheim .
That is important to us but here we are this evening , as a Parliament , talking about ship - building and buses and coaches which are very relevant to the citizens of Europe .
Why not have a complete market in buses and coaches ?
The reason why they do not want this on the floor today is because they voted against the amendments to help the disabled in the design of buses and coaches .
Buses and coaches are important products of the automotive industry and we need to have certain acceptable standards so that they can freely move around the single market place .
I have to say that as far as tourist coaches are concerned , the competition is extremely strong , while for the other categories of buses the market is currently opening up , because it was traditionally nationally based , as you know .
I certainly congratulate the Commissioner and endorse what he says about relationships with disability organisations as , for example , the work that his officials are involved with on the Bus and Coach Directive .
Amendments Nos 10 and 12 offer an alternative to the positioning of combustion heaters in the passenger compartment of coaches and minibuses .
Up to 45 000 people are killed each year on the roads within the European Union and 18 % of all these fatal accidents involve either trucks or coaches , often as a result of driver fatigue .
People rely on buses and coaches and the extra costs and lack of flexibility in using existing staff which these proposals would bring will have a knock - on effect which will lead to cutbacks in services .
It is said that when one foreigner in Tokyo said he wanted a bus to get somewhere , the hotel manager ordered a large coach .
Before long , our tourist coach down below looks quite tiny .
I remember standing beside our coach and gazing upward at what seemed like hundreds of busy ants coming and going from some nest in the ground to a food supply on the summit .
And then it seems a herculean effort to walk the short , flat distance to the coach .
It was almost like watching a video on fast - forward : The coaches would stop , and an empty park would suddenly sprout dozens of little tents . ”
The convention over , all the coaches headed north to the top end of the Australian continent .
A friend remained with her , but the coaches had to press on .
Every Sunday morning , we hired a coach that took us to scattered villages and smaller towns .
Along the way publishers were dropped off to preach , and then they were picked up by the coach on the return journey .
We can flip lorries , coaches , buses , anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power .
This has resulted in such outrages as fighting with dogs , cocks and bulls , the use of sleigh dogs , the large - scale breeding of animals for their furs , hunting and animal testing .
I would say in answer to the critics of this compromise text that it is an illusion to believe that the tale of the town musicians of Bremen - in which the ass , the dog , the cat and the cock set out for a faraway land , saying that they could find something better than death anywhere - applies in this case .
In Greece , Turkey and the Eastern Mediterranean , we slaughter a cock and daub its blood over the foundations of a new house .
Dogs bark and howl , bulls bellow , birds flit to their nests , hens collect together their chicks and cocks crow .
A white cock had been killed , the gushing blood being swallowed by the priest .
And now Kali and the cock were being transported to the temple , accompanied by drums and colorfully costumed figures .
If a cock has not found a mate , he continues his cheerful courtship song ( ah - bob - white ) even throughout the summer .
The cock begins his dance with spectacular “ waltzing ” movements in dainty circles , as if on tiptoe , with raised wings , displaying his beautiful plumage .
When instinct prompts pairing , the cock immediately gives attention to the building of the “ nest , ” if it can be called that .
The cock chooses a spot with a clear view all around and frantically loosens the ground with his powerful feet .
Consider this story of a cock that saw a train coming down a slope at full speed .
When egg - laying begins , the cock and his hen ( or hens , for he often is polygamous , especially in the wild ) take turns at sitting on the eggs .
On the other hand , the cocks , with their black plumage work the “ night shift . ”
To catch wild chickens , we would put a tame cock in a corral camouflaged with twigs and leaves .
His answer would be taken as a challenge to the nearby wild cocks , who would come running , looking for a fight .
For example , sometimes we would hear a crowing sound , just like a wild cock .
The cock digs a brood chamber in the compost , tests the temperature with his open beak , then steps back for the hen to lay an egg .
If she isn ’ t satisfied , the cock must find a more suitable place in the compost .
When she is satisfied and lays the egg , the cock scratches the pit shut again .
According to National Geographic Magazine , “ incest , homicide , privately making or selling purple cloth ( reserved for royalty alone ) or teaching shipbuilding to enemies might bring decapitation , impalement — or drowning in a sack with a hog , a cock , a viper , and an ape .
Other moving figures are a cock crowing , a Turk shaking his head , Vanity looking in a mirror , and Greed in the form of an avaricious moneylender .
But Jesus said : “ I tell you , Peter , A cock will not crow today until you have three times denied knowing me . ”
Then “ instantly , while he was yet speaking , a cock crowed .
And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter , and Peter recalled the utterance of the Lord when he said to him : ‘ Before a cock crows today you will disown me three times . ’
Three times it happened , and all in the courtyard where Jesus saw him after the cock crowed .
But Jesus knew Peter better : “ I tell you , Peter , A cock will not crow today until you have three times denied knowing me . ”
However , Jesus answered : “ I tell you , Peter , A cock will not crow today until you have three times denied knowing me . ”
At that moment a cock crowed , and Jesus turned and looked upon Peter , and he went outside and wept bitterly . — Luke 22 : 47 - 62 ; Mark 14 : 71 , 72 , The Jerusalem Bible .
A cock had crowed , and it sounded as if the bird was right under his pallet .
First the cock crowed , then the dog barked , next the turkey gobbled , and last the goat sounded off .
Just as Peter makes this third denial , a cock crows .
Immediately , Peter recalls what Jesus said only a few hours earlier in the upper room : “ Before a cock crows twice , even you will disown me three times . ”
The “ cockcrowing ” watch is of particular interest because of Jesus ’ words to Peter at Mark 14 : 30 : “ Before a cock crows twice , even you will disown me three times . ”
While some commentators maintain that the “ twice ” refers to specific points of time — midnight and dawn , respectively — A Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels , edited by James Hastings , indicates that “ as a matter of fact cocks crow during the night , in the East as elsewhere , at irregular times from midnight onward . ”
He had just finished calling at some homes in the village of Masías when he heard the sound of a cock crowing .
He thought to himself , “ If there is a cock , there must be a house somewhere — a house we have overlooked . ”
Jesus prophesied that , on the contrary , Peter would deny his Master three times that very night before a cock crowed twice .
Perhaps it was after this second denial that Peter heard a cock crowing , but he was too distracted to be reminded of the prophecy Jesus had uttered just hours earlier .
No sooner were the words out of his mouth than a cock crowed — the second one Peter heard that night . — John 18 : 26 , 27 ; Mark 14 : 71 , 72 .
&quot; I am not really convinced by your answer for the simple reason that you yourself are aware of the counter - arguments which you have mentioned and yet , on 18 July , in the French daily newspaper , Libération , you put your signature to an opinion column , along with seven other Ministers of the French Government saying , &quot; &quot; We must at European and international level find the means to implement a tax on financial transactions as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
On a final note about this Danish issue , I should like to add an impressive quote from Mrs Doornaert ’ s column in the Flemish newspaper : ‘ Europe appears to be unable to shake off its tendency for appeasement .
Last night , I read in a column by a Dutch analyst , who also happens to be a Russian expert , that according to the Russians , most of these areas or areas of cooperation can , by and large , be described as voids .
In order to unjustifiably discredit and perhaps in the vain attempt to get a few column inches in the Spanish press .
Columnist Harriet Van Horne expressed it very well , I thought , in her New York Post column .
That question was prompted by a recent Daedalus column in the British science magazine Nature .
“ If I could talk to the young girls who read your column , I would tell them that teenage sex doesn ’ t solve problems , it creates more .
Kazuhiko Nagoya , writing in his column for Tokyo ’ s Daily Yomiuri , commented on the warm way he was treated when he visited a meeting place of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses .
It &apos; s a sort of Ann Landers &apos; column writ large .
The job , though , came with one small downside . And that is : they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column .
If you ever are feeling lonely , get a New York Times column , because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails . And the email I &apos; m getting a lot today is about frustration .
&quot; One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support , and within 12 hours there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website , from users saying , &quot; &quot; Me too ! &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; Here &apos; s my tale of woe . &quot; &quot; I call it &quot; &quot; software rage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Who knows ? The New York Times Select , the op - ed page , asked me to do a column , and they said , you can do whatever you want .
&quot; So , once a month for the last year , I &apos; ve been doing a column called &quot; &quot; The Principles of Uncertainty , &quot; &quot; which , you know , I don &apos;t know who Heisenberg is , but I know I can throw that around now . You know , it &apos; s the principles of uncertainty , so , you know . &quot;
&quot; This is their newspaper , the &quot; &quot; Straight - Up News , &quot; &quot; that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages -- English and Spanish . &quot;
And once you have that , you can actually begin to build the neocortical column .
But , in fact , you can start , even though we haven &apos;t trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality .
So when we did this , we indeed , for the first time , saw these ghost - like structures : electrical objects appearing within the neocortical column .
But I think it is totally unacceptable that there can be a debate using these figures , which have been collated throughout the European Union , month by month , category by category , and only the column referring to Greece is empty .
This made it clear , in the remarks column , that one organisation , any single organisation within that spending line should not get more than 65 % .
You will also find , for the first time - not in the copy of annual report that you have in your hands today , but in the Official Journal version that will come when the official version has been printed , something that Parliament has asked for many years - the text of the Court in one column and the answers of the Commission on the same page so as to make the report , at least in this respect , more user - friendly .
Because this is no way to conduct a policy to combat employment and the periodic employment statistics published by Eurostat are making a laughing stock of my country because the column headed Greece is always blank .
I have already said : If you look at the column on the far left , there is country code today , and then indeed comes 350 .
In the column on the right , where the proposals are , it says quite clearly : regional code .
Then in the right - hand column there is a modern - English translation .
Just as your eye travels back and forth some forty - six times to read a column of type in this magazine so the TV camera beam used in the United States scans each picture or image in 525 lines .
Its copyist knew nothing of a supposed division between Isaiah chapters 39 and 40 , for in it what is now known as chapter 40 begins on the last line of the column that contains Isa chapter 39 .
Now look at the left - hand column where the Greek text appears , along with the word - for - word English translation .
Then draw six columns on a sheet of paper , heading them with the aforementioned fact - finding words ( who , what , why , when , where and how ) .
Thus , Vigouroux ’ famed French Dictionnaire de la Bible ( Dictionary of the Bible ) correctly says about what happened on the day of Pentecost : “ It was not a question of made - up languages , nor just of inarticulate cries , nor of rapturous exclamations , nor of figurative and enthusiastic expressions , but of languages known and spoken by other men , the use of which the Holy Spirit temporarily communicated to certain faithful ones . ” — Volume IV , column 80 .
He found that if he put the first seven elements ( with the exception of hydrogen , which is really in a class by itself ) in order in a column and then listed the next seven beside them , there was a remarkable similarity between each pair of elements .
Continuing in a third column , Mendeleyev found that potassium fell beside sodium , then calcium beside magnesium .
On this , Blaise Pascal , quoted in the column to the right , refers to Jesus as living “ in such obscurity ( according to what the world calls obscurity ) that historians writing only of important political events hardly noticed him . ”
Could it be that the reason they want to avoid a fight is because they evolved from chickens ? ” — Cal Thomas ’ column in the New York Daily News , Friday , August 22 , 1986 .
In the left - hand column on each page is the original koine Greek text , and under each line is a literal translation of the Greek .
In the right - hand column of each page , in modern - day English , is the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures .
In the “ Actual Spending ” column , enter the amount you currently spend for each item .
Remember , the total listed in the “ Amount Budgeted ” column can not be greater than your monthly income !
In the first column , list all income you expect to receive in a month .
In the second column , list how you plan to spend your money ; use the entries in your record as a guide .
As the month progresses , write in the third column the amount you actually spend on each of the planned expenses .
Wouldn ’ t you agree , though , that when you ’ re in the grip of a youthful crush , you tend to dwell on the more superficial qualities , such as those in the left - hand column ?
As you mature , however , you begin using your perceptive powers to examine deeper issues , such as those in the right - hand column .
In the first column , write down which aspects of the issue you feel most strongly about .
In the second column , list the aspects on which you feel that you could compromise .
It is surprising how many Christians take a look at these “ Horoscope ” columns and how many religiously govern their lives by the stars .
The history of our day proves that since 1914 it has been done and is still being done by those dedicated , baptized Christians known as Jehovah ’ s witnesses . — See The Americana Annual 1961 , page 396 , column 2 .
On page 134 , column 1 , lines 12 , 13 , edition of 1951 , this Lexicon prints first the Hebrew expression and then its meaning in German and in English and says : “ BENEI ELOHIM ( individual ) divine beings , gods . ”
And then on page 51 , column 1 , lines 2 , 3 , it says : “ BENEI HA - ELOHIM the ( single ) gods Genesis 6 : 2 ; Job 1 : 6 ; 2 : 1 ; 38 : 7 . ”
See the 1954 Yearbook of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses , page 62 ; also Jehovah ’ s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose , page 264 , column 1 .

In actual fact , the thing we are rushing into is the very model of the construction of Europe , by which I mean to say the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity whatever the traditions or special characteristics of the individual sectors , which once again has turned into a trap .
I shall conclude as I began : the idea and purpose of my speech have been to draw attention to the fact that changes on this scale should not take place without a democratic , ongoing debate , otherwise the deficit in citizenship and participation that many Europeans feel with regard to the model of European construction will continue to grow .
The fact that the European Community may have been an original construction , without historical precedent or pre-established models , can not mean that it should remain inexpressible or indefinable , and certainly not that it should remain incomplete .
Because if policies and models are conditional upon the fulfilment of people , the construction of justice and democracy , if policies are humanised , then we will overcome the abyss which separates people and we will be a genuine human family .
In its three versions , it established itself as a fundamental pillar in the construction of a real alternative to the neo -liberal model that Davos broadly represented .

The Verts / ALE Group &apos; s major concerns have been to make sure , inter alia , that ( i ) procedures should be transparent ( in particular , the standardisation bodies should not be monopolised by representatives of the major industries , and the concerns of SMEs or other stakeholders should be taken into account ) ; ( ii ) construction requirements and procedures should be able to boost innovative and more ecological patterns ; ( iii ) special procedures for &apos; micro-enterprises &apos; should not allow the industry to circumvent the requirements or procedures .
We do not have to abandon the principles which brought about the construction of the social model of protection , but we certainly have to redesign it to the new reality which it has to confront .
The questions of the number of commissioners and the weighting of votes on the Council are simultaneously insufficient to resolve the problems of transition to a new enlarged Europe and too much to alter the whole European construction model , without sufficient debate or the express consent of the electors , as though it were being brought in surreptitiously by the back door .
No , Mr President , the European integration model after Maastricht and , above all , after Amsterdam , has become a Community acquisition ; we are leaving behind the Community method of integration to adopt the intergovernmental method , the new method very dear to those who have obstructed the construction of the European Communities right from the outset or those who have disputed them or been afraid of their commencement and successes .

Quite clearly , risk prevention measures must be stepped up by improving vessel design and construction standards , one such measure being mandatory double hulls .
Also , it goes to show once again that the drafting of minimum safety standards with regard to the design , construction , operation and decommissioning of nuclear reactors within the European Union is a matter of extreme urgency .
Therefore , the cost of decommissioning nuclear installations must not be taken solely from European Union resources but must also be the responsibility of the Member States which are involved in the construction of installations .

This can be achieved by improving the construction of various commercial motor vehicles and by setting up dismantling facilities throughout the European Union .
In the light of these studies , the international community , perhaps including the European Community , might later finance the construction of such a storage facility .

If this is the case , how can we explain the fact that increased production and increased consumption have eaten up all the environmental initiatives which we have so far carried out and are carrying out ?
Up until now , the improvements that have been made have been offset by increased production and consumption .
As I see it , education is not a form of consumption , but an investment in the future , because we have to develop new products .
Ministers agreed that the key EU objectives to be achieved were , firstly , the setting of clear targets and time - frames , especially for water , sanitation and energy , secondly the establishment of a clear linkage between the political commitments and targets in the proposed action plan , and their implementation through initiatives or partnerships , and thirdly an agreement on the shift to sustainable patterns of consumption and production .

The production and consumption of tobacco increased dramatically in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .
I should like to see this directive apply to all tobacco products , not just cigarettes but also cigars , rolling tobacco and pipe tobacco for , while consumption of such products does not cause the same diseases , tobacco for oral use causes equally terrible devastation .

And they &apos; re doing a pretty good job there in the forest , working all the byproduct of their industry -- with OSB and particle board and so forth and so on -- but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption , and that &apos; s what &apos; s happening .
Déclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion .

And I &apos; m a very small part of a very large movement , which for some people is about survival , but is also about values , about a different kind of economy , which isn &apos;t so much about consumption and credit , but about things which matter to us .
How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption , not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve .
It will become more involved in social investment , and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others , not just from what you sell to them , and from relationships as well as from consumption .
Consumption , in that sense , is an expression of their productive potential .

So today I &apos; m going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption .
Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption , I &apos; d like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked , which is , where did this idea come from ?
&quot; Now I &apos; d like to say I woke up one morning and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos; m going to write about collaborative consumption , &quot; &quot; but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas . &quot;
So my co -author , Roo Rogers , and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption .

Finally , Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report , which , although geared more towards a specific sector , is a valuable contribution .
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument , which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and , moreover , would accord proper status to local bodies which , being independent , could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly , and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency , concentration and administrative reform .
I expect that Parliament &apos; s contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive .
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz , who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective .
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza .
In my judgement , this constitutes a guarantee to both sides , both from a political and a financial point of view , of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for .
But this also serves to make a claim , on the part of the European Union , for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public .
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution .
I was one of the first Portuguese Members of this House who , in 1986 , took the first steps towards the integration of Portugal into the European Union , and I have to say , Mr President - in - Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , that the experience I gained here , political experience , has been extremely important in my life , and that the information we gained and the contribution that we were all able to make towards building Europe definitely marked the years that I spent here , and indeed my life .
As a follow - up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions , the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime .
My reply to this is that , firstly , countries should honour their pledges , namely make 0.7 % of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation , so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long - term projects and via a route established for the purpose , namely contributions to development cooperation , and not via an artificial and probably harmful route , namely the Tobin tax .
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen , and I hope that , with the final decision of the Council , we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties , so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see .
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo &apos; s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors .
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States .
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action , among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social , as well as economic , development of a people .
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens : this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme , albeit with a scarcity of funds , can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal .
Madam President , I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur , Graa Moura , and Commissioner Reding , for their contribution to the creation of this programme .
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation , and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments .
In addition , I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood , especially where Community contributions are concerned , should incentivise .
Mr President , my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative , in Ireland in particular , has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area .
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000 - 2005 , boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union , and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective .
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme .
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission &apos; s proposals and Parliament and , having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions , I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made , with apologies if I can not attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name .
We must not forget Africa , a continent which has been forsaken , not only by God , but also by Europe , nor our important contribution to cooperating with development .
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead , you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and , as we have heard today , you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament .
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative , as appears from your contributions this afternoon , to formulate a single text .
PUST is an experiment to determine if it is possible to train generations of North Korean students - who have been shielded from many international influences - in the technical skills and knowledge required to make positive contributions to a global community undergoing rapid and constant change .
We &apos; d like to ask you to support our work for 2010 with a financial contribution .
Ritchie has made a tremendous amount of contribution to the computer industry , directly and indirectly affecting ( improving ) the lives of most people in the world , whether you know it or not .
As a contribution from me in competently implementing the execution sentences , I hope that this device interests the officials .
We were all moved by her conviction and her contribution to promoting respect for human rights in Malaysia .
Our massive contribution to air pollution and climate change directly affects the Philippines and contributes to natural disasters .
For these reasons the volunteer initiatives are making an important contribution towards building a caring and peaceful community for the refugees .
The tight controls imposed on Kurdish - language media by the government has meant that the population has struggled to make many significant contributions to the development of the Kurdish nationalist discourse — instead , Kurdish voices in Iraq and Turkey have dominated .
We give you our word , contribution , and sacrifice because we know first hand that nothing is easy , that there are many challenges for those of us who defend life as the cornerstone of existence .
One reason appears to be that within the body of each polyp there are microscopic plants that make a vital contribution to its digestive process and , like most plants , they are dependent on photosynthesis .
In this time of frustrations and changing values , you may be like many who are seeking to make their lives a worthwhile contribution to mankind ’ s welfare , toward remedying the world ’ s ills .
It would be a contribution to the peace within our midst . ”

But these clergymen ’ s statements are less a measure of their contribution to terrorism than are their actions .
“ To the average German industrial worker , this means a personal contribution of almost $ 130 a month .
Also in other fields , scientists have made genuine contributions to the welfare of mankind , all of which is commendable and very much appreciated .
Admittedly , their contribution toward solving the problem is minor .
Germans living in Germany , Austria , England and America made most of the important contributions to the piano ’ s development in the years that followed .
But two of Bach ’ s sons , Carl Phillipp Emanuel and Johann Christian , made significant contributions that aided the piano in gaining acceptance .
This brings us to the people of the “ Great River ” area , an interesting contribution to the temperament of the jungle .
And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation .
So , the emotional and intellectual profits are huge -- the acquisition of leadership , teaching and training principles , the sense of commitment , responsibility , generosity and dedication to others , and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals .
First of all , this is where we &apos; re projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming , under business as usual . Efficiency in end -use electricity and end -use of all energy is the low - hanging fruit . Efficiency and conservation : it &apos; s not a cost ; it &apos; s a profit . The sign is wrong .
I think that they are , that the statements that we make in this public sector are our contributions to a larger whole .
It &apos; s got to be that someday I can look back , and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make .
Don &apos;t take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people .
And Boltzmann &apos; s contribution was that he helped us understand entropy .
That is , military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materials - industrial cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil , which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security .
We can make a difference , and make a difference , not just for women , but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions .
There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes -- about 50 percent -- but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for .
I view Benoit Mandelbrot &apos; s work as one of the founding contributions to this kind of area .
What &apos; s also not often said about the space exploration , about the Apollo program , is the economic contribution it made .
It treats these maternal contributions as information , as what I like to call biological postcards from the world outside .
The incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience .
That is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing .

So we took these hundred dollar bills , and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com , where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions .
Now , to assist me in explaining this , I &apos; ve enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers , the reigning king of the metaphorians , a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor .
We could look across time at the same people -- people , for example , who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia -- and ask what the contribution of mothering , of genetics are , and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses .
So the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
It &apos; s a number -- very large -- a contribution to the economy of the United States for free .
With regard to Schengen , without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council , or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework , I would like to stress , on the topical subject of restoring border controls , that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority .
The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants . In terms of human rights , this is a backward step .
Despite having signed these international agreements , this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe can not achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened .
In the meantime , however , as has already been mentioned , the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded .
Mr President , Commissioner Nielson , the conclusion of the new ACP - EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence .
Well , he was wrong , and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances .
Meanwhile , on the trade side , pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO - compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so - called regional economic partnership arrangements or free - trade agreements .
In that respect we must recognise this innovation , this step , even if , as Mr Schulz just pointed out , simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step .
On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice , it is unacceptable for the Presidency - in - Office of the Council to be absent .
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention , which expires at the end of this month .
I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member .
On a separate matter altogether , I would like to support Cuba &apos; s membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lomé Convention which will shortly be agreed between the European Union and African , Caribbean and Pacific countries .
But we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lomé Convention , which has enabled relations between the European Union and the ACP to become what they are today : a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect .
Nevertheless , I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was , moreover , based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , just a few months ago we marked the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions on the protection of victims of armed conflicts .
We need to be pushing for the creation of a permanent international criminal court and urging our own Member States to sign and ratify the Convention .
As for the second section of the Convention , and in particular Articles 13 and 14 , which refer to protection from the effects of war for the wounded , the sick , the aged , children and expectant mothers , here it really is worth pausing to consider Kosovo and the findings of the relevant UN report .
Remember , too , the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages and remember the Convention for the International War Crimes Tribunal , which only Italy has ratified .
Keeping fingerprints for up to ten years , even if the person concerned has not committed any offence and even if they have perhaps , into the bargain , obtained legal residence in the area of the Union , is a violation of the demand under the European Convention on Human Rights for respect for private life .
We also finalised negotiation of the ACP agreements for the second Lomé Convention and we finalised the free trade agreement with South Africa .
The ACP / European Union Partnership Agreement for Development , which replaces the Lomé Convention , provides for a ten - year transition period for the ACP countries , to allow them to conform as closely as they can to WTO rules .
As regards the question concerning the possible suspension of our cooperation , although there could be grounds for suspending financial cooperation with Zimbabwe under the Lomé Convention , we take the view , for the moment , as indeed does Mrs Maes , that such a measure would run counter to our goal prior to the elections .
This war , which is presented as a conflict between producer countries , Latin American and dollar area countries against Lomé Convention countries and European overseas dependent territories , is actually a war between capitalist groups .
- ( FR ) This report gives us the opportunity to welcome the European Parliament &apos; s becoming aware of the need to defend the banana producers of , on the one hand , the ACP countries ( to whom we have made commitments in the course of renewing the Lomé Convention ) and , on the other hand , the outermost countries of the Community .
If there are clear signs of large - scale fraud and Mugabe remains in power illegally , then , according to the provisions of the Lomé Convention , aid must be halted .
What is more , this wording is drawn from the language used in other legal texts , for instance the Council decision concerning the approval by the Community of the FAO compliance agreement and the Council regulation laying down certain control measures in respect of vessels flying the flag of non-contracting parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources .
On the issue of Cuba becoming an observer to the convention in general , this is not foreseen , and in any case , Cuba has to make up its own mind what kind of relations it would like to try to establish .
We must take all the legislative and other measures needed to respect the rights of asylum seekers , by strictly applying the provisions of the Geneva Convention .
We would like to highlight and draw attention to the fact that formulating even more harmonized criteria for granting asylum by gradually and effectively moving away from those laid down in the Geneva Convention and essentially replacing them with regulations such as those mentioned in the report , may have a negative and repressive impact .
I have had representations to the effect that people are looking to the European Union for some kind of effective action , possibly - and this could be debated in the context of the resolution - some kind of sanctions under the Lomé Convention .
On 13 June , the Council warned the government of Liberia that it was not acting responsibly with regard to the situation in Sierra Leone , particularly in relation to the illegal trade in diamonds . The European Union will take this into account in its policy , especially within the framework of the Lomé Convention .
As far as the EU is concerned , the Council has informed the Fijians of its request to begin consultations under Article 366 of the Lomé Convention , which calls for a thorough examination of the situation on the basis of information to be supplied by the Fijians .
I welcome the fact that Article 366 of the Lomé Convention has been invoked .
At this moment we are engaging in the dialogue of the Lomé Convention , so at this stage we have not drawn conclusions .
Moreover , clear limits must be set for what may be recorded in Europol &apos; s investigation register , founded upon Article 10.1 of the Europol Convention .
&quot; Consequently , the description &quot; &quot; less developed &quot; &quot; is applied to the island regions as well as to the other regions and , according to Mr Barnier &apos; s proposal , what is required here is the amendment of the Italian text of the Treaty , in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention . &quot;
For my part , I want to highlight the need to adopt the convention universally so that it may become a total success , firstly by ensuring the compliance of the laws of the various states , so as not to have yet another example of an international agreement that fails to be applied .
I would therefore urge my counterparts in the national parliaments to ratify the two conventions that have yet to be ratified by all the Member States .
I believe we have adequate protection for such victims under Article 6 of the Council of Europe &apos; s Convention on Human Rights , and this report is yet another example of unnecessary proposed European interference into an area which is already covered by agreements between Member States , as well as 25 other non -EU members of the Council of Europe .
I should like to draw the honourable Member &apos; s attention to the fact that recital 3 of the draft directive does indeed stipulate that application thereof shall not be prejudicial to the commitments arising under the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees , as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967 .
At the same time , however , we must pursue the line of revising the Chicago Convention of 1944 so that we establish a different system in the international area .
Therefore , point 16 of the report concerning the renegotiation of the Convention is particularly welcome .
Mr President , I find the idea of a unilateral setting of EU aircraft fuel tax regimes entirely inappropriate , given that globally we are still subject to the Chicago Convention of 1944 , exempting kerosene from taxation internationally .
If those effects had been foreseen in the year I was born ( 1944 ) when the Chicago Convention was concluded , it is unlikely that tax exemption for fuel and other aircraft necessities would have been agreed upon .
An additional sum of EUR 25 million has been allocated by the Development DG under the Lomé Convention &apos; s Article 255 to assist UNHCR in a planned and orderly repatriation .
For the sake of consistency with that legal basis , the Commission also agrees with your rapporteur on the need to amend Article 21 of the Convention for the implementation of the Schengen Agreement , which regulates the movement of foreigners , rather than Article 18 .
As part of information campaigns , a tripartite Parliament , Commission and Member State body has been set up according to conventions that are now well - established , to general satisfaction .
When we deal with these subjects , however , I think it might be a good idea if , once in a while , we were to take stock of what we are actually doing when we take these initiatives , which are , of course , all offshoots of the Schengen Convention and ideas about the &apos; area of democracy , freedom and justice &apos; we talk so much about .
The European Community has supported Cameroon within the framework of the Lomé Convention with a grant of EUR 6 million for institutional reform in the area of the rule of law , democratisation and respect for human rights .
By way of example , the joint manual and joint consular instructions have become regulations , and new proposals under the third pillar complement or replace the equivalent provisions of the Schengen Convention , which have been assigned to this pillar .
Fortunately , the Council appears to have overcome these obstacles , at least partly , since in the road map published by the last Justice and Home Affairs Council , there is a discreet proposal for the Council to study &apos; arrangements for coordinated recourse &#91; ... &#93; to Article 2 ( 2 ) &apos; of the Schengen Convention .
So , ladies and gentlemen , what is Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Schengen Convention ?
Furthermore , it has ended the preferential system instituted by the Lomé Convention .
With regard to Europol , the Council first wishes to emphasise that since 1 May 1999 , the date on which the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force , all legislative decisions to be adopted on the grounds of the Europol Convention have been presented to the European Parliament for advice .
We are always being accused of drafting European norms and disregarding worldwide conventions .
I also call from this platform on all countries , especially those who have signed the UN Convention on Conventional Weapons , to apply an immediate moratorium at their next conference and pronounce a definitive ban on the use , production and supply of these weapons .
The Convention should draft two texts : a constitution , as desired by the majority , and an agreement between independent nations which cooperate on cross-border matters that we can not solve ourselves in our own countries &apos; parliaments .
I also welcome the fact that the issue of reaching agreement on the agencies , although certainly a negative point , was not blown out of all proportion as it was in the mass media . I have also noted the suggestions you have made on the subject of the Convention ;
The Spanish Presidency has said that the issues dealt with by the Convention must be very open and that its agreements and conclusions should inform the future decisions of the Intergovernmental Conference and the Treaty of 2004 .
The new Partnership Agreement is based on the right principles , enhancing the old Lomé Convention .
I wish to say , first of all , that , to my mind , the greatest success of this new Convention lies in the very fact that its moment has actually arrived , given the long and difficult obstacles that we have had to overcome .
The final outcome of these negotiations , in addition to the establishment of a new Convention for a period of twenty years , is therefore , to my mind , to be considered one of the more positive aspects .
However , Mr Rod always bears in mind that the very fact that the Lomé Convention exists and persists is , in itself , a success and a necessity .
As far as the conditions of movement of third -country nationals are concerned , for example , the draft directive abolishes the current obligation to declare themselves , under Article 22 of the Schengen Convention , when they move between EU countries .
This study led the Commission to review some of its proposals , including this proposal , specifically with regard to two points : we removed the requirement for the threat to be effective before residency status is granted , thereby providing for cases of potential risk as they can already be interpreted in light of the current wording of the Geneva Convention of 1951 ; we also removed the ban on implementing emergency expulsion measures as long as certain requirements are met .
From this perspective , the discussion that we are holding today is of major importance when you take a look at the timetable before us : the Convention and the IGC , the Commission &apos; s White Paper on Governance , the essential reform of Article 202 of the Treaty and the redrafting of the interinstitutional agreement on comitology , which patently does not take account of the evolving powers and role of the European Parliament as a legislator , in particular , in the economic and monetary Union .
I would like to stress that this definition is particularly important , at a time when the European Union must speak with the same voice at the negotiations that are currently taking place at the United Nations in New York on the adoption of the international convention on global terrorism .
As I told you , Mr Martínez , during the negotiations on the Cotonou agreement now in force , which were held in February 2000 , if my memory serves me correctly , there was already a formal proposal by the ACP committee for Cuba to join when the new Convention was signed , with the total agreement of the Council of the European Union .
When Cuba is ready to take on not only the benefits but also the obligations inherent to the Cotonou Convention , I guarantee that the Presidency of the Union and the Council will agree to it unreservedly .
In fact , we have one particular hope : that in November 2002 we may have an agreement at this 5th review conference of the Convention .
The USA , then , should not even give the impression that that it does not regard international agreements , the Geneva Convention , and so on , as binding when it comes to the treatment of terrorist suspects .
Instead of this , they have formulated a complicated procedure , under the terms of which funds are partly financed by the Community institutions , Parliament , the Council and the Commission , pursuant to an &apos; interinstitutional agreement &apos; that gives the aforementioned the right to examine Convention expenditure .
We can not accept the incorrect interpretation of the Geneva Convention , or the excessive criticism of US actions in it s handling of prisoners at Guantanamo , when the United States administration has made it clear that it will ensure that the basic human rights of all those held in custody will be respected .
we can not accept the incorrect interpretations of the Geneva Convention or the excessive criticism of US actions in it s handling of prisoners at Guantanamo when rights of all those held in custody will be respected ;
I am prepared to strike a good deal on this . The Convention should now make this a priority , so that this ridiculous travelling circus is done away with .
This will facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention which , as you well know , determines the Member State responsible for the examination of asylum applications .
It seems obvious to me that all the countries of West Africa are the Union &apos; s partners by means of the ACP Convention , and are signatories to the Coto nou Agreement and , therefore , do not only have a special relationship with the European Union , but also receive very considerable funds - we are talking about EUR 13 billion - for cooperation projects .
A good example is Article 50 of the Cotonou Convention .
Equatorial Guinea has already committed itself internally with the European Union and with the whole of the international community , as a signatory of the Convention against Torture , to begin the transition to democracy , in other words , to hold free elections in a context of respect for human rights .
To put it plainly , we need to challenge the hierarchy of rules which means that the WTO takes precedence over everything else , and therefore over all the international conventions designed to protect fundamental goods such as water and biodiversity , not to mention access to these fundamental goods .
Finally , Amendment No 17 is outside the scope of the inspections covered by the Directive and would contradict the principles of the Chicago Convention , and we must therefore reject it .
At the same time , it was emphasised that the principle of specific actions in an agreement should be viewed in the context of the work being undertaken in the Convention .
We strongly believe that multilateral arrangements and conventions , the UN , the G8 , the OSCE and others are the key to tackling the security , development and environmental problems which confront the world .
It is obvious that minors benefiting from international protection must have full access to the state education system ; this is an obvious fact recognised in several international conventions .
We are also opposed to making the specific stability requirements for ro - ro ships less stringent . Instead , we would argue in favour of maintaining the standards in question as adopted under international agreements and conventions .
So far , the Convention is off to a poor start , focusing as it does on the renationalisation of certain policies and a more intergovernmental approach , thus weakening the Commission and the European Parliament .
The main thing is that Parliament should be involved under an interinstitutional agreement , at the very latest by the time the Convention completes its reforms and the Treaty is amended .
Unfortunately , this agreement does not fully follow the Aarhus Convention as it does not allow the public to be fully involved in the development of policy which frames planning decisions .
In the absence of UN legitimacy and moral authority there is a duty on the countries prosecuting this war to do so in a way that is consistent with international norms and conventions .
Seafarers themselves and other workers need to fight for a different policy of radical change , not only to the system and to the safeguarding of free state education , but also to international agreements and conventions , so that they lay down minimum education levels , introduce strict provisions for determining ships &apos; crews and fully safeguard the employment and insurance rights of seafarers .
Just as the great rivers are shared and enjoyed by peoples of different languages , religions and nationalities , it is a cross -border resource and therefore requires international agreements and conventions for the sake of justice and sustainability .
As a universal resource , Europe must propose an international agreement , a convention which will allow rivers to be organised in accordance with river basins , as stated in the Directive on water , preventing a particular country from having the right to intervene in a manner which , as in the case of the Tigris and the Euphrates , leaves other nations in precarious situations .
In this context , the Presidency believes that greater involvement of the European Parliament in the Intergovernmental Conference &apos; s work is essential in order to safeguard the constitutional legacy of the Convention and to avoid falling back into the narrow , nationalistic ways of thinking that produced the obscure agreements at Nice .
This exchange of mail was governed by international agreements — not one overall convention , but rather a number of bilateral treaties .
For example , think of the position of the Watch Tower convention servant at Managua , Nicaragua , when he learned that the leaseholder who had rented the auditorium to him had lost his lease , and the contract with him was no longer valid .
Under the Coto nou Agreement , formerly known as the Lome Convention , African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods , duty - free , to the European Union market .
Secondly , the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions , which would allow us to be much more specific in our work .
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction .
Madam President , the work of the ACP - EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions .
Quite the contrary . I would like to remind you that an extremely large majority of the political groups in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe three weeks ago adopted a recommendation that not only recognised and applauded the European Union &apos; s initiative to provide itself with a Charter of Fundamental Rights , but which also supported and looked favourably on the European Union actually signing the European Convention on Human Rights .
&quot; Yet , from the outset , it dubbed itself the &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; , in spite of my protests , and subsequently continued to act as if it were a sovereign body , ranking higher than the institutions which had appointed it , and even nations . &quot;
It is from this ongoing dialogue between the European Council and the convention , or conference or assembly or forum , whatever we choose to call it ( let us not get into the dangerous territory of terminology ) that the right questions would be able to emerge . Finally , all the institutional implications could be drawn from it .
That is why we are calling for an assembly , similar to a convention , to be set up which will organise a public dialogue in Europe before decisions are made in the Council .
The Belgian Presidency hopes to be able to consolidate this progress at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 and 9 October and then build on it with regard to two additional aspects : the status of the candidate countries at the Convention and the organisation of a Civil Forum .
Firstly , I welcome the Convention . It is not a constituent assembly but it is all we could realistically achieve .
May I offer my congratulations to the co-rapporteurs for an excellent report and also to the Belgian Presidency for having carried the idea , born in Parliament , of preparing the next Intergovernmental Conference by means of a Convention nearly to fruition , although we still have the Laeken Summit to come .
And the right method is none other than a convention , a body which needs to reflect accurately all the current political forces in Europe .
The work of this convention , which we believe should be the subject of the fullest democratic dialogue , should result in a proposal which is a synthesis and product of all the views formulated at it .
It is also in that spirit that I appeal to the President of the European Parliament to allow our committee to become a permanent one , and I appeal to the President of the Commission to involve the parliaments of Europe in bioethics , so as not to deprive the public of this debate , and finally I appeal to the Heads of State and Government to commit to an international convention on bioethics .
At the informal European Council meeting in Ghent on 19 October , EU Member States promoted the Convention procedure to prepare for further reform of the EU / EC Treaties .
On that occasion , the Council laid down the decision to adopt a protocol as part of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union .
Mr President , time is short , so my only comment will be on the really historic decision to convene a constituent assembly which has already - albeit inaccurately - been called a Convention .
Ôhe European Parliament has every right to be proud because the idea of a Convention was mooted here , in this House , and took shape in the reports by the European Parliament , mainly from 1997 onwards .
Mr President , Commissioner , legitimacy can only be conferred by the people themselves , when they are directly consulted , and can not descend in the manner of the Holy Spirit out of such a distinguished Areopagus as our future Convention and , even more so , its praesidium , the most recent embodiment of what used to be called out - and - out despotism .
As I said , the Convention is a result of the effort made by both Parliament and the Commission and the will expressed by the 23rd COSAC meeting in Versailles in October 2000 .
Let us hope that the Convention , that great landmark in the history of European democracy , will serve to establish a positive synergy between the democratic institutions and civil society , which made it s presence felt in Barcelona during the European Council .
Apparently the Western European Union Assembly wants to be able to contribute to the Convention on Europe to ensure that the arms industry is boosted so that it can compete with places such as the United States .
My question , Mr President - in - Office of the Council , is whether or not the issues that are to be addressed at the European Councils will be referred at this historic moment to the competent institution , which is the Convention chaired by Mr Giscard d &apos; Estaing ?
The debates at the last meeting of the Convention , like the contributions that have already been submitted for the next meeting and the numerous expert opinions , bear witness to this complex situation .
It also comes , as you have pointed out , on the eve of a highly sensitive meeting of the Convention , at a time when we have spent a lot of time on useful discussions in debates of a general nature about the tasks of the Union , and are on the point of getting down to the heart of the matter , and when we are perhaps approaching a moment of truth .
Mr President , I would like to ask for your forgiveness since the Convention on the future of Europe is going to change things , as it is going to mean many meetings and much effort , but we will get there if we make that effort and if we are willing to talk , and that is what I wanted to do , by saying the following :
The first meeting of the parties to the Aarhus Convention on access to information , public participation and access to justice in environmental matters will take place at the end of October .

Mr President , at the Brussels European Council , the Chairman of the Convention presented the preparation of what he called a &apos; constitutional treaty &apos; .
Thirdly , a conclusion was reached that the European Convention should draw up its own final report in time for the European Council meeting at Thessaloniki .
I therefore call on this House and all the institutions represented in the Convention , and I appeal to all its Members directly not to miss this opportunity .
The major international meeting this April will decide to launch an evaluation of these conventions .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as Mr Yiannitsis said , the draft Constitutional Treaty , drawn up by the European Convention , will be the focus of the forthcoming European Council in Thessaloniki .
If it does not manage to conclude its work by 20 June , we must allow it to continue working to reach an agreement , which is perfectly feasible provided that the Convention plays it s full part as a constituent or para - constituent assembly , does not give in to blackmail by the small numbers of eurosceptics who have no interest in seeing it succeed - this needs to be said and reiterated - and asserts the value of an open , parliamentary working method which is very different from the intergovernmental method that is based exclusively on power politics .
Thessaloniki will mark the end of the European Convention when former president Giscard d &apos; Estaing presents his conclusions , as we have heard during the course of this debate .
At Laeken Heads of State and Government said that within the Union , the European institutions must be brought closer to its citizens , but if we look at the draft articles in the Convention document , we find this ambition has not been achieved .
This is our programme for the period between now and the last Convention meeting , scheduled for 10 July .
From the Assembly of the Republic ( the Portuguese parliament ) , the Socialist Party ( PS ) and Social Democratic Party ( PSD ) participated in the Convention .

. ( FR ) Including as it did the official presentation of the work of the Convention , the Thessaloniki Summit will obviously be remembered as a landmark European Council .
When in Rome , on 18 July , I handed over to the Italian Presidency the by then completed text of the draft constitutional treaty , I added - I shall quote this short passage in full , for Parliament &apos; s records - that the Convention has executed the mandate conferred on it by the Laeken European Council and has completed it .
For the first time in the history of European integration , the task was not entrusted to - albeit esteemed - government officials , but to a genuinely democratic , representative assembly , in other words to a Convention made up of representatives of the national parliaments , the European Parliament and the Commission , and representatives both of those countries which have been part of the European Union from the beginning and of those which are about to become full members of our great family .
It is no coincidence , for example , that the Constituent Assembly which wrote the marvellous Italian Constitution in the post -war period , had as its President the communist , Umberto Terracini , while our Convention is chaired by the extremely respectable but extremely moderate Mr Giscard d &apos; Estaing .
Mr President , the Convention was an assembly of all parliaments , all governments , and the Commission .
I would repeat my request that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs invite all the members of the Convention from the national parliaments and present them with this problem : how can the legislative Council be dismantled in the first session of the Intergovernmental Conference .
It would be a serious mistake to limit the role of the House which represents the peoples of the Union ; I believe that the provisions of the text adopted by the Convention are appropriate and should not be altered .

Those in this House , particularly on the Left , who believe it is all down to speculation are wrong , as you can not hoard physical oil in large quantities as a speculator and take delivery .
Among other things , Gazprom must also be able to give a public demonstration of its ability in practice to honour its commitments on deliveries in the future .
However , only a full and immediate ceasefire would allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that Gaza so desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services .

We also wish to see NGOs closely associated with the office in the consultative forum and , indeed , involved in delivering training or receiving it where they are part of the delivery of an asylum system in a Member State .
In actual fact , just like the concerns caused by Ukraine , the transit country for the Russian delivery , Turkey may similarly cause problems .

I believe that when this measure is implemented in the Member States , when consumers get to know about it , we will have to attempt to explain this many times , because in the case of a completely normal delivery of goods , EUR 40 is actually a good means of preventing these late payments that we want to put a stop to in Europe .
The fixed interest rate for late payments , proposed at 8 % , is an adequate deterrent for large firms too , the fixed 30 - day payment period is balanced for supplier and purchaser , and the 30 - day delivery verification period prevents abuse of the verification procedure for extending the payment period .

In most European deposits , gold is bound with other metals meaning that a separation method is required .
( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , I decided to speak on the topic in hand because I followed in detail events surrounding the prospecting and opening of the Mokrsko and Kašperské Hory deposits in the Czech Republic , where finely dispersed gold was to have been extracted through cyanidation .
We must not allow a situation , for example , if exploitation of deposits in the Arctic is to be undertaken by Norway and Russia , in which one of these countries is going to use technology which does not incorporate the highest standards of safety used by firms belonging to the European Union .
Within the EU , the Commission is supporting the exploration of essential raw material deposits , and this objective is promoted in particular by the ProMine 2009 - 2013 project , which comes under the Seventh Framework Programme .
Secondly , you have said that we need to increase supplies from other deposits , including European ones .

First of all , this programmatic requires that we should have the rules and institutions that will enable us to achieve our common objectives and , even before that , it requires that trust should be restored in the grand design for the integration of Europe .
This great act will enable the European public to feel themselves united in a truly common design .
The objective of these rules is to maintain credibility and trust regardless of the government in power at any given time . There is , however , a serious design flaw in the Stability and Growth Pact , one on which you , Commissioner , have repeatedly failed to comment .
To achieve those objectives , we have proposed technical assistance to make an immediate impact assessment and design of the rehabilitation and reconstruction requirements for the areas concerned .
Such prevention must first of all strike at the political design of an international terrorist network which attacks and rejects the cardinal values held by Europe and by democracies , which attacks citizens ’ fundamental rights – one of the pillars of European integration .

( AV ) ( New York Times , January 20 , 1969 , front page , last column ) Having his left hand at that Bible verse was , not accidental , but of design .
Satan ’ s “ designs ” are to devour any of God ’ s servants that he can , and he goes about “ like a roaring lion ” to accomplish that aim .
Now Satan ’ s design or aim would be to hold on to such prey until succeeding in completely swallowing up the man , destroying him spiritually .
Therefore , to stand firm against Satan ’ s designs , we need to be tactful and patient , becoming “ all things to people of all sorts . ” — 1 Corinthians 9 : 19 - 23 .

The Bible has opened their eyes to his true identity and his designs .
Okay , now getting to a part -- I want to show design in illusions . I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye . So that when you saw from one little angle was like this . And this little technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings , where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this .

&quot; Now , the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University , the teacher , Lanny Sommese , came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard , and wrote the word &quot; &quot; Apple &quot; &quot; underneath , and he said , &quot; &quot; OK . Lesson one . Listen up . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Great design is a never - ending journey of discovery -- for which it helps to pack a healthy sense of humor . Sociologist and surfer - turned - designer David Carson walks through a gorgeous slide deck of his work and found images .
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known , who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food , particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition , diet and such issues , so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority .
For many families with gluten intolerant children , life is very difficult and the extra work involved in managing their diet is tremendous .
The report clearly expresses consumer concerns in the face of the flood of additives , of chemicals , into our daily diet .
Indeed , our diet has changed radically under the influence of lifestyle changes and the contributions of new technologies .
Our diet , however , often contains a cocktail of different substances whose combined effect is rarely identified !
But it is clear that school milk has an added value for the dietary pattern of children and contributes to a better diet , particularly in urban areas .
The first is its social impact , as it ensures a minimum balanced diet for many children and young people who otherwise would not have access to one .
Finally , will it draw up and implement an integrated and effective policy to promote and advertise olive oil both in the EU countries and in third countries , so that olive oil can occupy the place to which it is entitled - according to scientific findings - in the human diet ?

By coincidence , this very afternoon I am off to Italy , a country that I love so much , to lecture about the benefits of the Mediterranean diet , which has been exported so successfully to the rest of the world , and therefore it saddens me all the more to make this speech criticising its government and it s rules in this area .

They are of regional importance , offer a high level of food safety , are a source of energy in the Mediterranean diet and make a valuable contribution to safeguarding the environment .
Do not roam down the lanes of healthy eating or comparative diets , however important in health promotion work such routes may be .
This is a basic requirement , enabling scientists to assess the exposure of consumers to substances through their diet .

These trees have a long history in the diets of many cultures , but they have grown in the wild and not been viewed as a crop for trade , giving farmers little incentive to grow them .
A total of 100 food plants were collected in various study areas — by no means a monotonous diet !
The diet of Eskimos still consists mainly of meat and fish , but it now includes a wide variety of other foods .
Hens have been compelled , by artificial diet and mode of living , to enter the ranks of mass producers .
The bittern is another bird that dolls up in a similar manner , because his diet resembles that of the heron .
Because while some of these chemicals in large quantities have produced cancer and other ill effects in experimental animals such as mice and rats , it is not certain that this is what happens in humans who are exposed to much less in their diet .
So , the mother needs good nutrition , perhaps even supplementing her diet with vitamins and minerals to assure this proper growth and development of not only the teeth but various tissues of the body as well .
Included in the diet each day should be a good variety of basic foodstuffs , including foods from the various food groupings : proteins , carbohydrates and fats .
Of course , there is no universal diet that will keep your child ’ s teeth decay - free throughout his life , but there are certain foods that are much better than others .
Modern diets contain much of refined sugars and rapidly fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose .
On the other hand , if the intake of refined foods is reduced or even eliminated from the diet of children , the decay rate is likewise slowed down or even stopped .
The buffalo did not go back to their regular diet nor did they stop their muddy medications until they were completely healed .
Most of these creatures do not get vitamin D in their diet .
A well - balanced diet is essential for everyone ’ s health .
Among other things prescribed are rest , hot or cold compresses around the neck , a light diet , possibly aspirin and / or antibiotics .
The Australian Medical Journal , January 12 , 1963 , told of a milk - free diet .
Here again , the trouble may be due to poor eating habits , not having a balanced diet , or not drinking sufficient water for this chemical plant to function properly .
Also experiments with hamsters ( mouselike creatures ) have shown that a diet high in sucrose , a form of sugar , is conducive to the forming of gallstones .
And they &apos; re giving about -- in a modern -day , caloric - restriction diet , I guess -- they &apos; re giving porridge , with a few grains of rice .
And what really intrigued me was when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent of environmentally caused cancers .
But I actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking : What could we be adding to our diet that &apos; s naturally antiangiogenic , that could boost the body &apos; s defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers ?
JC : Right . And along those lines , for people who might have risk factors for cancer , would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce ?
And I think in the information age , it doesn &apos;t take long to go to a credible source like PubMed , the National Library of Medicine , to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications .
&quot; Where you live : It impacts your health as much as diet and genes do , but it &apos; s not part of your medical records . At TEDMED , Bill Davenhall shows how overlooked government geo - data can mesh with mobile GPS apps to keep doctors in the loop . Call it &quot; &quot; geo-medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
The most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome , but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation , diet , microbes and parasites and our immune response .
You can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease , but they are very rare .
We also have found immune proteins related to infection and inflammation and proteins and DNA related to diet .
And so by applying ancient DNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus , we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet , infection and immunity thousands of years ago .
With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu -- and we &apos; ll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic , which is cardiovascular disease , diabetes , hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle .
It &apos; s not only preventable ; it &apos; s actually reversible . And for the last almost 29 years , we &apos; ve been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle , using these very high - tech , expensive , state - of - the - art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low - tech and low - cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography , before and after a year , and cardiac PET scans .
We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle , and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth , or inhibition of the tumor growth , compared to only nine percent in the control group .
And in fact , this molecule prevents this adipocyte , this fat stem cell , from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet , like the folks in my hometown of Chicago , fail to develop fatty liver , which is a major medical problem .
The pregnant woman &apos; s diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind .
Bread is not only standard in the Western diet .
So , within that larger context , we can talk about diet , stress management -- which are really these spiritual practices -- moderate exercise , smoking cessation , support groups and community -- which I ’ ll talk more about -- and some vitamins and supplements .
Insurance will cover the bypass , it ’ ll cover the angioplasty ; it won ’ t , until recently , cover diet and lifestyle .
So does cocaine , so does a high fat diet , so does emotional stress .
Now , one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food , which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food , or if you restrict entire categories of foods .
It ’ s not just what you exclude from your diet , but also what you include that ’ s protective .
Now , the problem with the Atkins diet , everybody knows people who have lost weight on it , but you can lose weight on amphetamines , you know , and fen - phen .
Now , what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet ?
And more seriously , there are case reports now of 16 - year - old girls who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet -- of bone disease , kidney disease , and so on .
So when you go on these kinds of diet , they begin to smell bad .
So , an optimal diet is low in fat , low in the bad carbs , high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats .
And then I wondered : was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle -- whichever group they were in -- and the changes in PSA ?
In Japan there has been a Diet Members &apos; League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty since 1993 .
Though Chi - Chi ’ s early zoo diet included chicken every other day , the panda gives refutation to “ higher criticism of the Bible ” that denies that all flesh first fed on vegetation .
Seaweed is a very basic taste in our Japanese cooking , and is often part of the daily diet in one form or another .

( Diet , Nutrition &amp; Cancer Prevention ) By this definition , if you take more than two drinks a day , in this cancer - prevention context , you are no longer moderate .
Later , in Noah ’ s day after the global Flood , God added animal flesh to mankind ’ s diet , though he prohibited the eating of blood .
In 1729 complaints were put before the Diet of the Swiss Reformed Church concerning his proposal to issue a Greek text with “ dangerous innovations . ”
Secondly , I believe that , as a result of this lack of political direction , the economic and financial dimension has experienced obstacles and delays .
Mr President , Mr Moscovici , Commissioner Barnier , although no progress was made at the Biarritz summit in the area of essential structural reform of the Union , I have faith in the ability of France , as the country holding the Presidency of the Council , under the leadership of her innovative President Chirac , to pilot structural solutions too in a direction which will cause the stream of development to continue to flow and which is acceptable to all at Nice also .
The Ombudsman looks after the public interest in the direction of the administration .

Who can explain to me to what extent Secretaries of State , working under the direction of their respective ministries , will be able to legislate more quickly than the ECOFIN Council ?
Special units , such as the unit set up to manage innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund , are a step in the right direction , they just need to be adequately staffed to make them effective .
I can only agree with Mr Lagendijk that &apos; conflict prevention implies stronger commitment and political direction on the part of the Member States , as the Community instruments alone are not enough to resolve all possible sources of conflict &apos; .
Now , more than ever , do we need political direction . We need clear timetables for the millennium objective , and we need a clear division of responsibilities .
Nevertheless , there are forces at work to block it , in the same way as it is being reduced to what is just a new agricultural programme under the direction of a certain large Member State .
This is , in particular , the case as regards relationships with national agencies in managing the decentralised parts of the programmes , or its intention to make progress , as soon as possible , in the direction indicated by the Court , in other words dismantling the temporary Technical Assistance Office as soon as the Commission is able to use an implementing agency for the educational programme .
They have pulled homewards in the direction of the Mediterranean , even though the country to hold the presidency has an obligation to create projects throughout the Union as a whole .

This revision has taken place in a climate of excellent cooperation under the direction of the political authorities of both institutions .
If we set out that clear direction , if we then combine it with a Commission – as this one under José Manuel Barroso ’ s leadership is fully capable of doing – that is prepared to send back some of the unnecessary regulation , peel back some of the bureaucracy and become a champion of a global , outward - looking competitive Europe , then it will not be hard to capture the imagination and support of the people of Europe .
It will continue to be difficult to see the positive effects of the euro if there is no coordinated management of either national budgets or the direction taken by the Member States ’ economic policies .
Ioannina has a place in Europe ’ s living history , since it was there , before the enlargement to fifteen Member States , that , under your direction , the Union ’ s Ministers for Foreign Affairs reached a memorable agreement that facilitates decision - making .
Mr Erdoğan &apos; s decree in response to the Turkish parliament &apos; s report on violence against women and killings on the alleged grounds of honour and morals is another move in the right direction , in that it incorporates many different aspects of policy on women &apos; s issues and instructs all ministries , public institutions and local authorities to be consistent in counteracting violence against women .
In this respect it was a good thing that , under the direction of our rapporteur , Markus Ferber , whom I warmly congratulate on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party and European Democrats , our committee , acting by a very comfortable majority , was able to add numerous important elements to the Commission proposal at first reading and to interpret and flesh out its provisions .
We are also grateful to the Commission which , under the direction of Mr Oreja , has followed our deliberations in the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media and has kept us informed throughout on the shifts of thinking in the Council .
We need strong political direction of the Commission as a whole .
If we do not want to let the WTO systematically dismantle the Lomé system instrument by instrument then it is high time that the Council at last showed leadership and used it s recognized pre-eminence to define clearly and to defend with determination the broad spheres of common interest such as development , clear and long term direction , including a set of foreign policy instruments .
As a general outline to this additional answer , I have to say , Mr Hautala , that the general secretaries of the three Institutions concerned have already held specific meetings to discuss this point and have formed an interinstitutional working party , under the direction of the Commission , which has been given the task of conducting a preliminary study of the problem .
But too often the Member States &apos; own government departments , de facto , stand in the way of progress in that direction .
This debate was needed because the Amsterdam Treaty strengthened Parliament &apos; s powers with regard to the investiture of the Commission President since the vote is now binding . It also strength the power of the nominated President with regard to the choice of the Commissioners - in agreement with the national governments - the definition of the Commission &apos; s programme and , once appointed , the political coordination and direction of the Members of the Commission .
But perhaps the most worrying thing is the confusion that exists , with constant changes of direction and a lack of impetus from those who are supposed to be in charge .
The restoration of the hope and confidence of the European citizens now depends on the Commission which , under the direction of President Prodi , today embarks on its course . This Commission has been granted , by this Parliament , the democratic legitimacy and transparency which the citizens demand .
These tie down the administration and can lead to far too little flexibility and a lack of accountability if we go too far in that direction .
To help mankind derive genuine satisfaction from those things that bring pleasure , Jehovah God has lovingly provided guidance and direction .
By refusal to be governed by God ’ s law , Adam and Eve deprived themselves of divine direction and guidance .

One individual may be more willing to receive the spirit and follow its guidance than another who may be quenching the spirit by not walking wholly according to its direction .
PERHAPS the greatest cause for apathy in religious matters is the feeling shared by multitudes of persons that there is among their religious organizations no real direction , no single worthy purpose for which to labor , nothing to become enthusiastic about .

Unfortunately , the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented .
Nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .
In conclusion , I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction , we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which , if it were realised , would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states .
In this regard , I liked your term , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .

At the same time , we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction .
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU .
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction .
Unfortunately , developments are not moving in that direction .
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations , which seems to go in a different direction .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Members of the Commission , five months after its coming into office , the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union .

&quot; I guess that slowly people start to understand that this is not a discussion about &quot; &quot; piracy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; thieves &quot; &quot; but about the direction in which our civilisation is heading . &quot;
Still , not all the scientific community is convinced that this policy is the right direction to take in the fight against HIV .
Filmmaker Mariel Brown was sceptical of the direction in which the Minister wants to take the film industry :

&quot; We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , &quot; &quot; Thank you . That &apos; s exactly what I needed today , &quot; &quot; and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions . &quot;
&quot; Well , this from &quot; &quot; The Purpose Driven Life &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life , the compass I rely on for direction , the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything . &quot; &quot; &quot;

But you can see also , once again -- so some places are much more wired than others , and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S. , going up over to Asia , Europe in the other direction , and so forth .
We just took a simple sailing boat and we tried to pull something long and heavy , but as we tacked back and forth , what we lost was two things : we were losing pulling power and direction .

Some days , I &apos; m as shallow as a baking pan , but I still stretch miles in all directions .
Everybody &apos; s &apos; right to a satellite dish &apos; is not enough : you need the money to get one .
Imagine what can come into houses through a dish in the remotest parts of the world .
By using his channel selector , together with a small satellite dish and a receiver costing EUR 130 , he can watch 1 400 television channels .
Satellite dishes were banned until recently , and the country ’ s citizens are not allowed into the small number of hotels where foreigners have access to the foreign press .
The ten per cent of Belarusians who have satellite dishes can currently watch the broadcasts .
It would be pertinent for the Government to take note of this as it has become a policy not to make referrals when irregular tariffs and taxes are collected by Government , as has been the cases relating to the VAT on registration and past payments on satellite dishes .
At the moment , according to information channelled to us by non-government organisations , a campaign is under way to remove satellite dishes and hence further obstruct access to the free media .
In August 2011 Berdymukhamedov ordered that cable television replace satellite dishes .
If you know someone with a dish , chances are it is less than two years old .
In fact , if a dish owner wishes to unscramble all his channels , it could cost as much as $ 1,000 per year in fees !
Why spend all that money on a dish without knowing what it will cost to use it a year from now or what you will be able to see ?
By means of a special dish called a parabolic antenna , designed to focus all the signals falling onto it , concentrating them at a single point much the same way a magnifying glass intensifies the sun ’ s rays .
Mashala , one of the drivers , explains that he is transporting televisions , video recorders , and satellite dishes .
In my town “ we all have satellite dishes , ” he explains .
For instance , very faint radio signals , such as those emitted by pulsars , are better received and processed by the larger single dishes , such as the one in Parkes .
And so , we have to drop in satellite dishes . We put in generators .
And a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish , a printer , binder and cutter , and kids make their own books .
Now this didn &apos;t make any sense , and like any reasonable engineer or scientist , they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself , it must be the dish .

For many , a bowl of hot oatmeal ( preferably not the “ quick ” kind ) is hard to beat when it comes to a dish that is nourishing , easily digested and economical .
What will be used for the next meal can be kept in covered dishes , and what will not be used for even a longer time may be quickly dried and stored in plastic bags , tightly shut to exclude air .
A minimum would be a large ( 1 - or 2 - quart ) jar with a very wide mouth , a piece of cheesecloth to cover the top of it , a rubber band and a dish such as a pie plate .
For example , white dishes that seem lost in a white cupboard look striking in a cabinet lined with deep green . ”

After dinner , he cleans and scrapes the dishes , while I wash the stove , counters and put away leftovers ....
You are also willing to erect the dish — generally from eight to ten feet ( 2.4 to 3 m ) in diameter — in your yard .
Another dish that has been prepared is broiled tai , or red snapper , artfully arranged on the plate in a half - moon shape , with the fish ’ s head and tail intact .
A large glass or plastic jar , a nonmetallic pot , a glass or ceramic bowl , or a deep dish will do just fine .
Larger seeds , such as mung beans , may do better in a deep dish or pot .
In a family meal , it is customary for each member to use his or her own pair of chopsticks to take pieces from the common dishes and put them right into the mouth .
because you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish , but inside they are full of plunder and immoderateness .
Blind Pharisee , cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish , that the outside of it also may become clean .
Blind Pharisee , cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish , that the outside of it also may become clean . ”
The hum and buzz , the coming and going broke the monotony of those stacks of plates and dishes to dry each day and the never - ending baskets of stockings to mend — like the bottomless pit !
For example , if you allowed dirt to accumulate on your dishes and silverware , germs would multiply , and a child could easily get sick if permitted to eat from these things .
As the dish came around , each person carefully looked over the pieces to make sure that he took the biggest one .
First , he proclaims woe on them because they cleanse “ the outside of the cup and of the dish , but inside they are full of plunder and immoderateness . ”
So he admonishes : “ Cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish , that the outside of it also may become clean . ”
How were the Pharisees like an unclean cup or dish ?
Blind Pharisee , cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish , that the outside of it also may become clean . ” — Matthew 23 : 25 , 26 .
The outer appearance of a cup , a dish , or even a building reveals only so much .
I sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of Popular Science magazine , for four dollars each .
It &apos; s currently 10 billion miles away from Earth , transmitting with that dish , with the power of 20 watts , and we &apos; re still in contact with it .
Sound and clear warnings about all kinds of diseases and disorders are therefore , in our opinion , a matter of greatest importance .
Multiply that by all the diseases and disorders , physical and mental , add the impact of ending the communist system in Eastern Europe and the two - way cross-border movement of health problems , from environmental pollution to sexual and drug - related diseases , and the economic impact of health problems is colossal .
The sector is also certain to expand , not only in the traditional field of transplants - for example , corneal and skin grafts and heart valves - but also , as a result of advances in biotechnology , in those of reconstructive surgery , reproductive medicine and the treatment of disorders such as cancer , diabetes and Parkinson &apos; s disease .
This does not mean - and I am addressing Mrs Montfort and the other Members who have raised the point - that we are claiming that embryonic stem cells are the magic answer to all genetically - related problems and disorders ; we merely feel that these research possibilities should not be eliminated and that they should certainly not be eliminated through a directive which is concerned with other matters , which seeks to regulate pragmatically a promising market and an activity which is necessary for the life and health of many European citizens .
Then there are the diseases and disorders beyond the three priorities of TB , AIDS and malaria .
For the first cycle , in the period 2004 to 2010 , we have selected a number of diseases and priority substances for particular consideration : childhood respiratory diseases , asthma and allergies , neurodevelopment disorders , childhood cancer , and endocrine disrupting effects .
Poor countries are not only up against the problem of debt . They have to face many other disturbing problems including lack of access to education and health care , mental disorders , depression , suicide , addiction , various diseases , the forced prostitution of women and children and even human trafficking .
I believe this research is essential for the fight against genetic disorders and against the scourges of modern life such as Alzheimer ’ s or Parkinson ’ s disease .

Madam President , I fully agree with the rapporteur that the package of measures from the Commission is a first step towards tackling the specific problems of the border regions , because we are taking a step back into the past , when the current borders of Member States were in many cases inside the old Austro - Hungarian and Ottoman Empires .
They are a legacy of the Austro - Hungarian Empire and so the only other country that could have had them in the past was Austria , and that is no longer the case .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , this Parliament is like the Tower of Babel , an allegory of the Habsburg Empire , which was full of sycophants .

Never in history has the hub of an empire conceded it s hegemony to its far - flung outposts .
If we understand , however , that European integration is itself nothing more than a Trojan horse , in place to establish the ideological and trading empire centred on the United States , with outposts in every corner of the world , then we see that Mr Miranda has produced the report of a loyal servant of that country &apos; s blueprint for the world .

If the federalists make this mistake , all will become clear in the eyes of the people , and we shall plainly see the true face of the European Union , as an outpost of the empire of the United States , and it s true purpose of grinding down the European nations until they are nothing more than casualties of US world domination .
This is absolute madness , because let there be no doubt , it is not the United Nations that is waging war , it is the Empire .
In both cases , we are witnessing the unleashing of an empire , which is using every possible excuse to inflict on a nation - and , there is no doubt , via this nation , on the whole world - a display of its military capability .
Due to the fact , ladies and gentlemen , that the empire and its propaganda are so deeply engrained in our minds , we are losing sight of the most basic logic and even the most basic common sense .
Who , if not the empire , is flouting the law , and as I said earlier in relation to Iraq , the UN Charter , to which we are all bound , in the war that it unilaterally decided to enter into , first in Kosovo , then in Afghanistan and now in Iraq ?
The American people are themselves victims of the unleashing of the empire .
They are emerging from the nightmare of Communism . We must not relinquish their freedom simply for the benefit of a new empire .
In fact , those who we call terrorists exist the world over ; their numbers are on the increase and they are becoming more radical even as the empire steps up its increasingly violent domination against the populations whose values and secrets it disregards and which it demonises , even though they are obviously in a different category in military terms .
That the Kirch empire has collapsed can be of little comfort in view of the pressure exerted on public service broadcasters by commercial enterprises - I am referring to the cost of rights to sporting events among other things - and in view of an increasing concentration of regional , national and worldwide media with growing cross-border involvements .
The international community is nothing but a hollow formula for supporting the empire and its Anglo - Saxon flunkeys .

&quot; However , this House , too , has quite rightly taken a number of decisions this week about European budgetary rights , as you have pointed out , Mr President . In both cases – as regards the Legislative Council , which is to prevent any transparency and allow the national bureaucrats to carry on working as before , and as regards undermining Parliament &apos; s rights in relation to the budget – I am reminded of a series of films , the second of which is called &quot; &quot; The Empire Strikes Back &quot; &quot; . &quot;

Such organisations and foundations have become quite common throughout the states of the former empire .
It is the European Union &apos; s attempt to build an international empire based on a unified creed , with federalists , liberals , cosmopolitans and sycophant humanist thinkers .

&quot; And at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; &quot; Thank you Plato , thank you Shakespeare , thank you Jane Austen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
And that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts , to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes , detectors , instruments that people are building , or have built , in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail .
Those two trucks you see at the very end carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium .
And because it was in Union Square Park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
&quot; It was decades before the term &quot; &quot; black hole &quot; &quot; was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they &apos; re the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime . &quot;
It would be like a near - death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel , but it &apos; s a total death experience .
And there &apos; s no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel .
At the end of their lives , they &apos; re going around each other very near the speed of light .
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end .
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock .
&quot; This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said , &quot; &quot; If you want to do this , call me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time , down to the tenths of a microsecond , that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately , or they do a lot of what &apos; s called trouble talk , where they &apos; re like , &quot; &quot; Wait , who is this ? Oh . &quot; &quot; Right ? &quot;
And then wow , what a radical idea , we -- except in the United States -- might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line .
And so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses Internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other .
And when we go to COP15 at the end of this year we can &apos;t stop thinking of padding CO2 .
This applies especially to firms in the countries that want to join the EU ; mention equity capital there , and you find that most firms do not have any at all , and that there , the borrowing of capital from outside sources , along with bank credit , prevail to the exclusion of all else .
Mr President , Commissioner , and those ladies and gentlemen who are not yet present , it is clear to all of us , how significant equity capital and risk capital are in terms of Europe &apos; s achievement of the Lisbon objectives .
We must be aware that they suffer a glaring lack of equity capital , and that even the banks there find this very difficult . If we want to build prosperity there , with a market economy that works , we have to consider how these businesses get their hands on the capital they need once they are working in the European Union .
What do you think the impact of Basel II will be on the 40 % of companies in Europe that do not have any equity capital , what will the impact be on tax revenue and what will the effect be on the candidate countries ?
The present situation is that tourism enterprises do not , as a rule , have equity capital , are financed in the long term , and rating is too expensive for them .
I fully agree with you that SMEs in general and tourism enterprises in particular , which often do not have much equity capital , are most vulnerable if borrowing or lending become too tight .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is expected that the Basel Committee will , this autumn , come to a decision on the equity capital of banks in the future .
The report calls for even further reductions for SMEs and for reductions in the bank capital requirements for venture capital and equity investments in start - up companies .
All three of them need better framework conditions , and so I am also glad that the Austrian tax reform reduces the tax burden when profits are not withdrawn , as this strengthens equity capital .
Banks calculate equity capital on the basis of the risk of loans being defaulted on , and this , in its turn , of course , has an effect on the interest charged to the borrowers .
For the most part these businesses have little equity capital .
Ministers have agreed to expand the visa ban list to include serving members of the military of the rank of brigadier - general and above , and members of their families , and prohibit EU - registered companies or organisations from making any finance , such as loans or equity , available to named Burmese state - owned enterprises .
The fact is that negative equity is one of the main problems facing the tourism sector ; a great many enterprises are going bankrupt , with the loss of large numbers of jobs .
We believe that banking supervision must be internationally agreed and of the same kind throughout the EU , and that , in particular the banks ’ equity capital required by law must be more rigorously adjusted to take account of commercial risks .
We do unfortunately have race conflicts and there is no equity at all for seed and tractors .
I would like to congratulate the accounting officer , Mr Taverne , and his predecessor , Brian Gray , while reiterating my incomprehension regarding the negative equity of EUR 47 billion , which is essentially due to the fact that we are not accounting for the claims that we have on Member States based on the commitments that they have made for staff pensions .
The initiative is valid and necessary , but this fund needs to be swelled with the EU resources that are already available in the budget and linked to forms of financing guaranteed by the European Investment Bank and / or other financial institutions , so that it can have an adequate share in the equity of the individual public - private partnerships that are in operation .
This issue must , therefore , be put back on the agenda , and we must go further with regard to supervision , banks &apos; equity capital , prohibition of certain financial products and the fight against tax havens .
In other words , it should be possible to re -invest profits as equity capital .
This would provide the best basis for striking a balance between risk capital and equity capital for the orderly financing of loans .
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) is defined as &apos; a long - lasting investment , representing at least 10 % of the affiliated company &apos; s equity capital / shares and providing the investor with managerial control over the affiliated company &apos; s operations &apos; .
In the definition given by the Court of Justice of the EU , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) means &apos; a long - lasting investment , representing at least 10 % of the affiliated company &apos; s equity capital / shares and providing the investor with managerial control over the affiliated company &apos; s operations &apos; .
However , the fact is of course that not much direct Union funding has been available , for example , to deal with the main difficult problems , when one bears in mind that at present the worst funding problems of all lie precisely in the fields of obtaining equity capital and venture capital and - in my country at least - excessive cautiousness on the part of the banks when it comes to extending credit .
Now , what is the Commission proposing , and in particular in what form and how quickly , to face the structural shortcomings in equity capital of SMEs , the problems of management which they come up against ?
To start with evidently existing banking rules on equity capital and risk are still fundamentally inadequate .
Sufficient equity capital , however , is essential for the long - term success of a company .
Owing to the fact that its shareholders do not expect high interest rates and the thus possible low gearing rate , that is the ratio of the lending volume to equity capital , of 2.5 - market rates are usually over 10 - the Bank enjoys considerable confidence on the capital markets .
Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa were Bain Capital and KKR , the big boys of private equity .
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty , dependency and alienation with equity , initiative and participation .
Policies that address issues of social justice and equity are as central as economic policy to growth and poverty reduction .
In this spirit , I am willing to admit that we shall have to look closely into all the possible means of achieving this twofold objective of stability and equity , adopting an open - minded and realistic approach .
This report turns its back on what the European public really needs : a public service that is coordinated and harmonised at European level , which could guarantee a high standard of efficiency , safety and equity for employees and users alike , right away .
So we are talking about a question of equity and changing public opinion and we appreciate the matter being left to the Irish Government to decide and to influence public opinion .

The third point is the introduction of elements of stability into sporting competitions in order to ensure their equity and regularity .
At one end it requires that decisions be taken as close to the people affected as is consistent with efficiency and equity .
But that implies that many decisions can only be taken at the other end , at the higher level , when , for the sake of equity and efficiency , the whole of a great polity must be included .
There are , however , four key areas where we have to develop appropriate strategies . They are intergenerational equity , distribution of work , social and family policy and immigration .
This policy should help ease labour shortages , improve intergenerational equity and give the citizens a more satisfying old age .
The question today is whether the new decision on own resources effectively makes progress towards greater equity and transparency and takes more account of the Member States &apos; tax capacity .
The Member States &apos; contributions via the fourth resource or VAT must be proportionate with their contribution to the Community GDP as a key element of safeguarding the equity of the system .
Two points which should be obvious to all of us , as democrats concerned about issues such as global social equity , but nevertheless important to make .
As a member of the church he referred to , I have some views about the way it could contribute rather more to the debate about universal human rights as well to the debate about social equity , but since Mr Bertonotti was unfortunately not able to stay until the end of this debate , I will sit down .
It is essential in the interests of equity across the Union .
Any economy , in order to be able to export , should create endogenous growth , itself creating greater equity within a country .

Please tell me which agreement or conclusion speaks of equity or redistribution .
If we are to retain the uniqueness of the European Union , then we must ensure that social equity is not sacrificed in pursuit of the goal of liberalisation and competitiveness .
I want to pick up on certain aspects where , for once - unlike last year &apos; s Spring Summit - we looked at issues relating to global equity to some extent .
It will focus on three main areas : first , consolidation of the rule of law and protection of human rights ; secondly , local and rural development based on participation , inclusion and equity ; and thirdly , equitable economic growth and job creation .
Thirdly , the question regarding institutional balance is fair and maintains the equity and equality between the Member States .
In seeking and prioritising its own interests , however , the West does not behave with justice and equity in its international relations , but rather it generates a new form of anti-democratic autarchy which will end up bringing it into conflict with the rest of the world and will lead to its unsustainable decline .
In the interests of equity , productivity and social stability , we must address the serious issue of Europe &apos; s greying population and so we must create the optimum conditions for jobs .
The government is working on a plan known as ‘ The Seven Tools of Equity ’ , which are : educational revolution , social protection , promoting economic solidarity , social management of the countryside , of public services , a country of owners and quality of urban life .
The country we want for our children and future citizens must be a country of peace and equity .
Everyone today can see to what extent the European Union ’ s credibility , people ’ s expectations of it and what it will become with the hoped - for adoption of the Constitution are focussed around the question of human rights and democracy , and I do not believe we will be able to get a European way of doing things accepted in dialogue , in credibility and in equity if we are incapable of making considerable progress internally , between our institutions .
What we need is not a cosmetic public relations exercise but a fundamental , thoroughgoing reform of the institutions and the rules of world trade so that sustainability and equity are genuinely put at their heart .
This focus aims to accelerate European Union action in three key areas : governance , interconnection and equity .
The report drawn up by my fellow Member , Mrs Svensson , clearly articulates the need for greater equity in health care provision .
For the time being , I can see many more disadvantages than advantages to doing this : the danger of stimulating even more the inflationary pressures that are already too much in evidence ; the danger of taking the momentum out of an often lifeless internal demand ; and the problem in terms of the social equity of such restructuring .
There must also be equity and proportionality within that sanction regime .
But there is no equity or fairness when a logbook offence in one country leads to a fine of only EUR 96 , whereas in another country this could lead to the confiscation of boat , catch and gear .
But once one of the free - wheeling states is asked to pedal , then there are cries for equity , for fairness and for a level playing field .
The EU must match that shift and demonstrate the crucial equality and equity required to the creation of a Palestinian state , living in peace with Israel .
I must also say that this matter ought to be resolved in such a way as to contribute towards not only improving road safety on Europe ’ s motorways but also ensuring economic equity as regards development and growth in the transport sector throughout the Member States .
Import prices are artificially low ; there can not be any fair competition when the starting points are so wide apart and there is no equity when dumping is the rule .
The idea that the aim of sustainability and social equity , as set out in Gothenburg , should also form part of this strategy has been completely disregarded .
Whilst bilateral trade agreements have their place , it is multilateral trade negotiations in a multilateral framework for the international trading system that , in our view , are best able to bring equity and balance to the international trading system .
Secondly , what I see today is that we have a policy for the whole territory of the European Union , a policy adapted to the challenges of globalisation , of enlargement , of increased diversity , consistent with the principle of equity , adaptable to very different regional contexts and responding to the needs of territories and cities .
The compilation of a scientific ranking of gender equity in the labour market would be an effective measure for the reduction of inequality , but one must also find the facts on one ’ s own .
Or is it not a problem that there is no equity anywhere in the areas of employment , in privatisation , in state institutions , or education ?
The first paragraph of the resolution says : &apos; the overarching aim of development cooperation is and must be the fight against poverty ; stresses , however , that this fight is not limited to material growth and therefore , democracy - building and the promotion of basic human rights , rule of law and the principles of justice , equity , transparency and accountability must always be central themes of any such cooperation . &apos; 
Further , last year , in our 2006 communication on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems , the Commission stressed the importance of pre-primary , pre-school , education as an effective means to reduce school drop - out rates , and pointed to the dangers of tracking pupils too early .
Of course , in saying that Member States &apos; basic responsibility is the system and the content , we believe that quality or efficiency and equity followed by Member States could deliver more concrete and better answers for our citizens , including the young .
Efficiency and equity in European education and training systems ( debate )
The next item is the report by Tomáš Zatloukal , on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education , on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems .
I think this is really desirable , of course , but it is frequently , and wrongly , assumed that efficiency and equity are mutually exclusive .
As part of our commitment to helping Member States improve their education and training systems , the Commission &apos; s communication showed that efficiency and equity do not have to come at the expense of each other , at the expense of quality .
Efficiency and equity are , in effect , mutually enforcing .
I am also pleased to notice that you confirm our message that early tracking of pupils has detrimental effects on efficiency and equity .
A European educational area with a common goal , namely the Lisbon objectives , also needs a common approach to achieve efficiency and equity .
Furthermore , I can not agree with paragraph 21 of the report , which states that free university education does not necessarily guarantee equity .
As regards the equity of educational and training systems , I believe that Member States should find the necessary means to increase the degree of access to education and training of children , young people and adults .
It therefore seems essential to me to underline the call to Member States to invest much more in a public network of nurseries supplied with teachers with high - quality training , capable of dealing with all children , as this is one of the most effective means of developing their intellect , establishing the basis for future education , raising overall skills levels , significantly increasing the equity of the education system and combating social inequalities .
I believe the Commission and Member States must put as much emphasis on quality as on efficiency and equity .
I believe that promoting equity and efficiency in education is both a moral duty and a fundamental financial / economic need .
The principle of equity should provide a baseline for a gradual improvement that has to start from a baseline if emission figures admissible in 2050 are to be calculated .

The benefits of early education include : the promotion of social equity , increased individual and broader social productivity , reduced levels of poverty , and the elimination of discriminatory attitudes and social exclusion .
The clearly formulated intention that retirement systems should emphasise equity and social effectiveness also combats poverty .
Like Martin Schulz , I congratulate Javier Solana on walking that long lonely path of speaking to people that nobody else would speak to , of opening the doors of dialogue , because ultimately only through dialogue between enemies can you make peace , and only through peace can you build the foundations of a solid two - state solution that will guarantee peace , equity , security and justice within the Middle East .
Both Croatia and Slovenia must recognise that international law is necessary but , of course , also that the principles of equity , fairness and a just solution - a political solution , if you want to describe it in that way - are essential .
Likewise , I agree with the rapporteur , Mr Swoboda , when he says that we need to observe the principle of equity , which is part of international law .
We need to move away from a narrow focus on net balances and move towards an approach based on solidarity , burden - sharing and equity .
On the other hand , he points to science and its “ method for building a safe new world , resolving the differences between nations , creating peace without fear , hunger and disease , with undreamt - of wealth , dignity and happiness ; a world not based on force but on decency , equity and good will . ”
Can one expect justice and equity from an economic system that , in two weeks , spends for military purposes amounts that it is said could provide drinking water and basic health care to all the world ’ s population ?
And that tragedy of massive proportions embraces the millions of women who suffer daily at the hands of a bullying husband , a father , or any other male — a male who fails to “ meet the tests of equity and justice . ”
Human rights and social equity have lagged far behind technical and material progress .
“ National and global governance have to be reinvented — with human development and equity at their core , ” admits the Human Development Report 1999 .
Dad explained : “ The Queen once said that she wished that she had the wisdom of Solomon so that she could rule her people with equity and justice .
By so doing , they are preparing for everlasting life under Christ ’ s rulership of our earth , which will be transformed into a paradise of justice and equity .
Now , this is not only about numbers ; this is not only about the fact that we &apos; re seven billion people committed to nine billion people , it &apos; s an equity issue as well .
If you go over the education spending and the health care spending -- particularly these long - term trends -- you don &apos;t have that type of involvement on a number that &apos; s more important in terms of equity , in terms of learning .
It can reach into millennia that have been buried , and return them in a just and unexpected equity .
With PISA , we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity , in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances .
Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity ?
But actually , if you look at how countries come out on this picture , you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity .
In fact , one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don &apos;t have to compromise equity to achieve excellence .
And the good news is , nine years later , you can see improvements in quality and equity .
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system , raise quality and improve equity , and so did Hungary .
We built this institution based on social justice , gender equity , this idea of empowering women .
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that , in any case , the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act , and to prevent and rectify the course of events .
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group , which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle .
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union , what consequences would that have for free competition ?
As soon as the course of events became known , my group tabled an oral question on the matter in order to obtain clarification of the questions of principle which had been raised and of the inevitable consequences .
On the contrary , the answer means being prepared to draw conclusions from the unhappy events of the past , so that the same thing does not happen again in the future .
Having said that , Mr Prodi , the real challenge would be if , in coming months , you did not endorse this motion for a resolution , in the event that Parliament votes in favour of it tomorrow .
It is always easy to be wise after the event and no doubt if we do proceed apace we may not achieve a 100 % satisfactory outcome .
This is an agreement adopted by the Council of Ministers as a result of initiatives by certain Member States and which I also support , since I believe that a good budgetary policy provides greater room for manoeuvre in the event of difficulties .
In any event , I congratulate Mrs González Álvarez once again on the results she has achieved .
The European Union will continue to follow developments in that country in the light of these principles and will not fail to draw the necessary conclusions in the event that these principles are not adhered to .
He knew , nonetheless , that this miracle was not a random event , but rather the outcome of proactive and constructive commitment , based on common objectives and efficient institutions .
Recent events have given us grounds to think that these are possible consequences , which must be prevented at all costs .
Secondly , the scope of the directive must , in any event , be sufficiently broad and systematically include those plans which have a significant impact on the environment .
I should like to point out that at the Summit of the Heads of State and Government which was held on 19 and 20 June this year in Santa Maria da Feira , in Portugal , the Council expressed its outrage at the tragic events related to terrorism in Europe and vigorously reaffirmed its commitment to continuing to fight terrorism at European level and to stepping up and intensifying cooperation between Member States in this area .
Nevertheless , it would have been good if everything could have proceeded a little faster than it has in the event .
The truth is that this is the result of a disastrous event that occurred two years ago .
The second event that stood out at Biarritz , for the right reasons this time , was the return of democracy to Serbia and , more than this , the repercussions of the political changes in Belgrade on relations between that country and the European Union .
When I think of the problems and the events in developing countries , such as those in the ACP area or in Central America , it is evident that things can not continue like this .
Lastly , in the undesirable event that negotiations should fail , the Union has a political and moral duty to support the fishermen and shipowners with a reasonable amount of aid that will ensure that they have the means to live .
Given that this special programme of EUR 450 million , of which the European Union is guaranteeing 65 % , specifies that at a provisioning rate of 9 % only EUR 26 million will have to be transferred from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund , there will only be a budgetary impact in the event of a default , because in that case the guarantee would have to be called in .
We are talking about public health , and hence of serious events , which must be treated as such , in a strict and , of course , transparent manner .
F1 events and , in particular , Mr Ecclestone &apos; s work to preserve the monopoly in the field , have been looked into for years now , but no results have been forthcoming .
At all events , the consequences of a failed sanctions regime against Baghdad are incalculable .
&quot; I want to make it clear that under Article 51 , subsection 5 of the Euratom Basic Standards 96 / 29 , cooperation is obligatory , and I quote : &quot; &quot; each Member State shall , in the event of a radiological emergency occurring at an installation on its territory or being likely to have radiological consequences on its territory , establish relations to obtain cooperation with any other Member State or non-Member State which may be involved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
This is a matter which , in any event , must be taken seriously and to its conclusion , regardless of the consequences .
Mr President , the recent events in Turkish prisons are tragic by any standards and it is an enormous pity that the situation had been allowed to deteriorate over such a long period with the almost inevitable consequences .
Mr Kinnock &apos; s reform must serve some purpose . Let us see whether or not , this time , the aid to alleviate the consequences of the earthquake arrive before another tragic event strikes this sister country .
I agree with you in the event that there is a failure in the implementation of the laws which we have put into place , that this can result in a falling - off in consumer confidence .
In any event , despite the limitations of this directive , we acknowledge that some positive changes have been made to the final position and we hope that the Member States will pay particular attention to this aspect of artistic and literary creation and to promoting the distribution thereof , whilst respecting copyright .
The next item is the report ( A5- 0077 / 2001 ) by Mr Wiebenga , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures promoting a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 303 - C5-0387 / 2000 - 2000 / 0127 ( CNS ) &#93; .
Commissioner , I notice that you have in any event made some moves towards a policy whereby infection and vaccination do not immediately lead to the removal from farms .
&quot; Following recent events and their serious impact on public health and the food chain , such as &quot; &quot; mad cows &quot; &quot; , dioxin , the depleted uranium bombs dropped on Yugoslavia and a host of other incidents , we find it very hard to believe the EU &apos; s professed interest in , or the sincerity of , its declarations of good intent regarding public health . &quot;
A ban on the sponsorship of youth events would ultimately deprive clubs of vital income .
I shall finish by saying that , in any event , it appears essential to monitor the real impact of implementing this agreement .
Firstly : the European Parliament proposed that ceilings should be placed on the financial liability of classification societies in the event of an accident caused by wilful act , omission or gross negligence in their survey work .
In all events , we shall promote continuing dialogue leading to tangible results .
This is why there are so many incidents like the recent events in Kabylie , with their shocking death - toll and the resulting alienation between the country &apos; s young people and it s ruling class .
In any event , the Article 29 procedure is designed to achieve a result through transparency , and the decision is the risk manager &apos; s .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Erika I , which is aimed at preventing environmental disasters from oil spills before the event , is now supplemented by Erika II , which is also designed as an instrument for accurately assessing the consequences of such disasters and for improving the system of compensation of the victims , the aspect on which my report concentrates .
In any event , in the 2001 update of the stability programme , which is due to be presented by the end of the year , the Greek authorities will undertake the necessary adjustment of their medium - term macroeconomic outlook and an assessment of the impact of this on public finances .
We emphasise that , in the event of an accident , the responsibility should lie exclusively with the company , including responsibility for the environmental consequences , and that the mining industry should be included in the future Directive on environmental liability .
The Commission in its report also refers to the vagueness of the requirement for an information and consultation meeting to be held with the workers as soon as possible in the event of exceptional circumstances which affect employees .
These are the major events which have taken place in the area of cross-border cooperation .
Despite the demarcation of powers , the Commission is responsible for safeguarding standard application in the event of effects being felt from one State to another .
In any event , we in the European Parliament delegation for relations with the countries of Central America were in El Salvador in July and were able to see the consequences of the earthquakes and of Hurricane Mitch .
The World Bank has produced a report showing that between 20000 and 40 000 children per day will die of hunger because of the economic recession caused by the events of 11 September .
Turning to Mr Posselt &apos; s comment on the risk to this region of negative fallout from the events of 11 September and thereafter , this is something we will include in the analysis .
We are including this region because we fear and predict that humanitarian aid requirements will increase as a foreseeable , indirect consequence of the said events .
The report states that an act of malice - and this was presented to us before September - could initiate a sequence of events that release radioactive material in the liquid high - level waste tanks , in Sellafield in particular , with effects much greater and more devastating than Chernobyl .
According to Belarusian blogger and activist Zmieter Soltan ( listen below to our podcast interview with Zmieter ) , the campaign involved several Belarusian online communities on LiveJournal : “ There were multiple posts with photos of Dzianis , updates on the investigation of his case , on the likely charges which would be put against him , photos of his mother and girlfriend , reports about the event when he was arrested , regular updates on the money raised to date , accounts from visits to the prison . ”
&quot; Medina called the event a &quot; &quot; fatal coincidence &quot; &quot; and also assured that the agents involved in the raid informed that the vehicle with the baby was briefly stopped , and that they gave the ambulance the order to go ahead when they noticed that it was carrying a very sick baby . &quot;
( 6 ) They ignore all the evidence , both scientific and Biblical , for a worldwide deluge forty - three centuries ago , so they do not recognize the drastic effects that such a cataclysmic event must have had on the samples they measure from that period .
Again the question is one of matching words with events and actions .
At the conclusion of an event , 38,000 light bulbs instantaneously flashed the results , along with the athlete ’ s picture and standing , on two giant screens , each four stories high .
Another vulnerable point in modern society is the instant impact of news events .
As a result , Russian athletes went into the world arena of international sports competition with a marked edge , dominating most of the sports events at the time .
Certainly , such disruptive events could change radioactivity levels , thus distorting results from modern - day radioactive clocks .
However , a Harvard University study in the United States found that of over 2,500,000 patients discharged from hospitals in New York State in a single year , nearly 100,000 had suffered “ adverse events , ” or injuries caused by medical management as opposed to disease .
Devoid of real substance , are such religious events having any lasting effect on youths today ?
Each event that had spectators on the edges of their seats was fixed .
Lenin ’ s party , the Bolsheviks , took control of the Russian revolution , and the direct result of that event is the Russia we see today .
Even today , some simply accept the consequence of catastrophic natural events as fate or an act of God .
Can anyone honestly say that the shocking and horrifying events that have tainted the pages of human history were the normal activity of humans ?
As a result of the human genome process , we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean -- like an erupting volcano , or something of that sort -- can actually be sampled .
The more intact , the more complete , the more complex your food web , the higher the resilience , the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short - term impacts of warming events .
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents , that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma . Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .
Mr President , I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE - DE Group , but also as an elected representative for Brittany , and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events .
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated .
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though , it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them .
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation .
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree .
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary .
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States .
Nevertheless , the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right .
In this light , the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic .
Confronted with this threat , which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe , nothing must deter us : not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit , not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene , not the derisory respect for formal democracy , and , above all , not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control .
With regard to the events of recent days , I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day , and the week , that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which , given what we have said about the Austrian crisis , I believe should be fully included in the Treaties .
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential .
The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health .
Human rights , which the EU embraces , are thus under threat , but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated .
Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there , some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House ; they can not go unpunished .
Helsinki was an historic event , an historic turning - point and an historic new reference point .
So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development , and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations , as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle .
This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido .
The Burma Review blog compares the events from 8888 to the Quit India Movement launched by Gandhi in 1942 to end the British rule .
Some Iranian bloggers outside Iran considered this event important and wrote about it too .
I respect those who risk their life to take photos , videos and report about the latest events to reach to international news media .
It is difficult for me to comment on this case because it seems like such an absurd action to warrant imprisonment , especially because Fouad did not commit fraud or even damage the reputation of the Prince ( I did read several different versions of the events and some painted Fouad in a more scandalous light ) .
Ghariba wrote in detail about the events , quoting BBC Arabic , and adding a video of the clashes in El Mahala , where the textile factories and the heart of the strike was , featuring scenes of chaos : The blogger added :
The idea is for the event to get people inspired , talking and making changes . It has also allowed others to participate not only as viewers .
I am certain that many in the blogosphere will dedicate some posts to commemorate this tragic event .
After the recent confusing events in Honduras , where the elected President Zelaya was demoted by the military and shipped off to Costa Rica while in his pajamas and a new President , Micheletti has taken power and declared a curfew among other measures to keep order , while citizens try to make sense of the situation , as shown on this past post .
Events since the election have really started to eliminate the walls between Iranians inside and outside the country .
He was moved to write this song because of the events in Iran .
There will also be short talks given each week to acquaint those present with enlightening and fascinating background information about persons , places , plants , animals and many significant events mentioned in the Bible .
The “ Peace on Earth ” Assembly at Papeete , Tahiti , was a grand event , too , not only for the local Witnesses , but for the islanders in general .
What we see is in reality , in actual human experience , calling for the breaking of the seals of the scroll once again , in a supplementary way , in our own marvelous century so full of events of universal interest and importance .
People hurried to find cameras , lenses , special filters , smoked glasses , welding masks , visors improvised from cardboard boxes , developed film , containers with water or anything that might help them view a most extraordinary event without danger .
Oh , the minutes before the great event seem to be passing so slowly for some , and for others they are passing very fast .
They surround the event with mysticism in order to trick the unwary .
For this reason God long ago commanded his people : “ There should not be found in you anyone ... who employs divination , a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer , or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead .
But the greatest mystery of all time deals with events of real life in our own day !
It would not be the first time that the faith of people had been damaged by believing evidence that was unfounded while the event itself was the truth .
Current events and Bible prophecy show that this world empire of false religion is fast nearing its end .
WWB : Wind , water , birds -- stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events , all of it very healthy , all of it sound that we evolved to over the years .
We think of space as a silent place . But physicist Janna Levin says the universe has a soundtrack -- a sonic composition that records some of the most dramatic events in outer space . An accessible and mind - expanding soundwalk through the universe .
Traumatized people also easily lose control -- symptoms are hyper - arousal and memory flashbacks -- so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly , suddenly , and they can not control it .
We want things that are designed for how they &apos; re used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100 percent , and that is a severe flu pandemic .
Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event .
But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn &apos;t doom us to suffer indefinitely .
It seems that somehow , a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets .
This is a cold - water event called La Nina .
When we have extreme El Nino events , you see all this red , and you see no green out here around the Galapagos .
And to me this is a really remarkable story , and a remarkable opportunity . Going back to Newton with absolute space -- didn &apos;t provide anything but an arena , a stage in which the events of the universe take place .
So one of the things thought of in the &apos; 80s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the Galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event .
And what we found after drilling back in time two to 400 years was that these were unique events .
So these events in our recent past really are unique .
There &apos; s an inherent problem with low probability events .
You know , my work is inspired by events such as this .
Even in my gallery shows , I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid , distill only its emotional residue and image my own life .
Just briefly , what &apos; s your take on the current events there and the intervention ?
I happen to live in a little town , Princeton , in New Jersey , which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history : the Battle of Princeton , which was , in fact , a very important battle .
Yet instead of grasping this opportunity , local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada , the events of 9 / 11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission , since the evaluation , control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects .
That does not detract from the full responsibility that the Commission assumes , as the Treaty requires , for the execution of the Community budget .
For instance , the proposals of the Commission to increase the responsibility of authorising officers for the execution of commitments and payments while bringing to an end the centralised system of prior approval of transactions by the financial controller , together with the creation of an independent internal audit service , is in line with the key requirement for improved financial management that we lay down in our Opinion No 4 / 97 .
The Commission is of the opinion that questions regarding delays in the execution of the project must be put to the competent Greek authorities .
In order to guarantee the future of that programme and to determine its guidelines and scope , we shall soon be beginning to draft a new decision on the execution of the programme from 2003 onwards , and Mr Wijkman &apos; s opinions and those given in the report we are discussing will obviously be taken into consideration .
Amendment No 18 seeking to delete Article 7 is not acceptable to the Commission because it will make the execution of the programme very difficult .
But it must be clear that responsibility for the proper and economic execution of the transferred tasks lies with the Commission , which is subject to discharge by Parliament , which means there can be no discharge for the agencies themselves .
The framework regulation for executive agencies defines a new form of Community institution that operates in the service of the Commission and has the task of managing and implementing Community programmes independently on the Commission &apos; s behalf , including the associated execution of budget resources .
It means that the Commission &apos; s responsibility for the execution of the budget under Article 274 of the EC Treaty is retained without qualification .
I should also like to add that the European Parliament grants the discharge for the execution of the executive agency &apos; s administrative and operational resources .
The execution of contracts , however , is a matter which , in the first instance , falls under the competent services of Europol .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the reports we are discussing confirm some of my concerns regarding the execution of the Structural Funds for the 1993 - 1999 period but , alas , also regarding the new programming period which will end in 2006 .
Given that this is for preparatory action , and in accordance with the rules on the execution of the budget , the Commission really does not require a legal basis for these preliminary expenses , but it is nevertheless aware that it can not develop the SIS II without calling on the experience of Member States in relation to the current SIS and its operation .
They obtained that stay of execution for the CAP , which was facing the death penalty , so well , in fact , that when Poland accedes to Europe , Polish farmers will be deceived because they will be joining the Europe of the CAP when in fact , from 2005 onwards , there will no longer be one .
The time has come to make a clear distinction between intellectual services and executive services , between design and execution .
Not everything , not every service can be compared to a work of art , but the products of the mind can not be confused with mere execution .
Joint contract awards , where contracts for executive design alone and execution are awarded together , are appropriate if there are intellectual service providers qualified as such according to the prevailing legislation in the company or attached to it .
These considerations are the basis both for the amendment which makes it possible to award contracts for the design and execution of works either separately or together but requires justification to be produced where mixed contracts are awarded , and for the amendment which clearly defines what is meant by preliminary project paper , final project paper and executive project paper .
Amendments Nos 4 , 9 , 44 in part , 56 , 90 in part , 93 , 97 in part , and 108 in part concerning observance of other legislation , in particular social legislation , clauses relating to the execution of contracts and provisions concerning sub-contracting .
The Commission is , therefore , opposed to imposing a separation between the design and the execution of works .
Mr President , Commissioner , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism believes that Parliament , as the budgetary authority , must be regularly informed about the execution underway for structural actions so that the alarm can be raised in terms of the application of the sunset clause .
The general forecasts , including those of the Council , exceed the ceiling of the financial perspectives by EUR 125 million , with the contribution of a growth of 9 % for the budget of the Council , which will now ask for cuts , while criticising the bad execution of some policies .
We are talking about poor execution and poor management .
Mr President , Commissioner , the amending budget we are debating today , practically in private , reveals , as has been stated , a disease endemic throughout the execution of payment appropriations , because , given the amount in question , we are not talking about an exception , but the rule .
Firstly , the Commission should improve its working systems both in the preparatory phase and in the execution phase .
I would like to mention two key points : firstly , the Commission proposes a better structure for the cycle of policy coordination based on three points : execution , political orientations and guidelines .
Specific execution is still in the hands of the States and global coordination in the hands of Eurocontrol .
Both dimensions of Article 202 are absolutely essential : defining mandates and scrutinising their execution .
In 1996 a conciliation body was set up to resolve any conflicts between the Commission and the Member States , and accreditation of the paying agencies responsible for execution and payments in the Member States was introduced .
Regarding the Sapard programme , the Commission has promised the Committee on Budgetary Control and Parliament that top priority would be given to improving the programme &apos; s execution .
I have committed myself fully to increasing and improving these interrelationships with regard to the management of our programme . I am convinced that in this way the execution of actions in the field of energy will be carried out in a way which is coherent with the different Community instruments .
Its allocation is based on indicators defined by the Member State , in agreement with the Commission , which reflect the efficiency , management and financial execution of programmes and allow the results to be measured , in relation to the objective defined by the programme .
The financial execution of the fund in 2001 was generally acceptable .
The complex issue - and this has been a very controversial point - of awarding design and execution contracts jointly , appreciated and appreciable for some specific categories of contracts , can not be a hard and fast rule .
It is in this spirit that I have some reluctance in accepting some further amendments relating to different subjects such as e-auctions , framework agreements , dynamic purchasing systems , the competitive dialogue and the choice between separate or joint awarding of contracts for design and execution of works contracts .
I agree with the Commission that the best way to protect investors is through a strong combination of competition , conduct of business rules , conflict of interest rules , best execution rules and transparency .
Finally , it is vital that we accept the committee &apos; s amendments on execution - only business .
Execution only is not a continental practice and by suddenly imposing it we would run the risk of destabilising many investors .
I noted in passing your particular concern regarding good execution of appropriations in the new Member States for 2004 - 2006 , a concern that I entirely share .
As we are preparing to adopt , as I said earlier , and submit to you the third report on economic , social and territorial cohesion , it is clear , as you have constantly pointed out yourselves , that good execution of the Structural Funds and Community initiatives is one of the conditions required for this ambitious policy that we wish to preserve and revive to be credible .
It may be the case that by doing so the Commission wanted to speed up the procedures in order to facilitate the execution for 2004 but I sincerely believe that it has exceeded its powers .
Article 49 ( 2 ) of the new financial regulation , approved last year , lays down that , except in relation to institutional prerogatives , pilot projects , preparatory actions and operational appropriations for each institution , all other operational expenses will require a basic instrument for their execution .
With regard to economic resources – mentioned by the rapporteur – we have given up our initial desire for greater allocation of funds for the sake of the interinstitutional agreement , but we have a commitment from the Commission to maintain adequate execution of the programme and we believe , however , that the decentralised cooperation line must continue to increase and not be a minor budget line from which funds can be taken in order to fill other gaps .
Despite the war , the execution of the quotas allocated by the agreement , as in the case of tuna , has been good , and the level of catches of demersal species is improving .
It is regrettable that the European Parliament should have approved this path so far , accepting in the current process a growth in payment appropriations of only 2.3 % , which will penalise execution , a reduction in payment appropriations for the Structural Funds , a financial package for the codecision programmes that falls short of what is needed , and the financing of Iraqi reconstruction to the detriment of cooperation and development in other regions of the world .
In any event – apart from the traditional horizontal amendments relating to performance facilities and improvements in execution – our fundamental intention in this heading is to hold very serious discussions with the Council on the funding of the Agencies .
The rigour and austerity we all apply – the three institutions – is one thing , but the indiscriminate saving of payment appropriations , which could jeopardise budgetary execution in 2005 , is quite another .
In return , we hope that the organisation of the Commission ’ s services will operate perfectly and that this small change we are introducing can lead to better execution of the budget by the various Directorates - General .
The Constitution confirms the Commission &apos; s important responsibilities in foreign affairs , including it s role in external representation of the Union and in the execution of the budget .
The responsibility of the Commission for the execution of the budget and in relation to Community policies should be preserved .
This report addresses the surplus resulting from the execution of the budget for 2004 .
These will be elaborated on in the specific programme decisions and during the execution of the programme , which is the responsibility of the Commission .
As in other years , as we Members of this Parliament well know , we are facing the same budgetary problems relating to execution and political representativeness .
Nevertheless , from a European point of view , it is not good news , because the saving results from a very significant under - execution in payment appropriations corresponding to the Structural Funds .
We also agreed a joint statement with the other two institutions , in which the Council committed itself to presenting an amending budget which would include the payment appropriations necessary to pay Structural Funds , in the event that the execution was as expected .
I believe that this is the lesson that we must learn this year , and let us hope that the execution is better during 2006 .
However , we will keep a close eye on the Commission and the execution of this programme .
The proposal aims to provide a more transparent and simplified framework for the execution of Community financial interventions .
The involvement of private capital is indispensable to the execution of programmes and to the consistent implementation of structure change and modernisation .
In order to make the European energy network a reality , we must prevent unnecessary delays in the execution of projects , particularly those of European interest .
Best execution requirements for asset management are distinct from those of the brokers , and this should be recognised in the Commission ’ s implementing measures currently under review by the European Parliament and the European Securities Committee .
Let me highlight just three : the reinforcement of Member States &apos; responsibility to improve expenditure control in order to achieve a positive Court of Auditor &apos; s statement , an improvement in the execution of EU programmes and an effective input from Parliament into the budgetary review in 2008 .
I am somewhat perplexed that the Commission did not accept our modification which sought to clarify the best execution obligations of investment firms towards clients when dealing on their own account .
As requested by Parliament , the Commission has prepared a joint declaration in which the Commission commits itself to presenting an assessment of the budgetary execution of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the 2007 - 2013 programming period , including the consequences of the implementation of the decommitment rule .
The Council and the Member States also have their own responsibility , since , with the current institutional architecture , it is difficult to go any further with financial control of the budget and the execution of spending .
It includes powerful tools for stimulating private investment in research , though it calls for greater parliamentary control throughout the execution of the Programme .
This can be guaranteed by keeping research separate from execution .
I consider that customs brokers provide the necessary guarantee of knowledge and experience for the execution of customs operations and therefore they must be considered accredited customs representatives .
In its programme for 2008 , however , the Commission offers us , as a principal social solidarity measure , the management or execution of the Solidarity Fund , which alleviates the situation of people losing their jobs following restructurings resulting from globalisation .
I would like to begin by commenting on the execution of the general budget of the Committee on Civil Liberties , and I can do so very briefly .
With regard to the execution of the budget for Eurojust ( the European judicial cooperation body ) , we note that the Court of Auditors has reasonable guarantees that the annual accounts for this financial year have been reliable and , with regard to the corresponding operations , that they are all legal , as they should be , and regular .
With regard to the execution of the budget of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia , the committee is satisfied here as well , with regard to the legality of the underlying operations .
Finally , I shall deal with the execution of the budget of the Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction .
With regard to the Commission &apos; s management , we welcome the substantial increase in the execution of payments and we hope that this trend will continue in 2007 , although we know that this year is going to be the start of a new programming period and our experience shows us that it is more difficult to fulfil this goal and that there is a degree of delay .
Despite a string of critical conclusions relating to the evaluation of budget execution for 2006 , a positive application was submitted to Parliament for the discharge to be issued .
For these time limits to remain feasible we have to continue the efforts to coordinate the fiscal policies of the government with the monetary policies of the central bank and this takes moderation and prudence in the budget execution .
The NBR &apos; s inflation targeting policy has to be supported by fiscal stability , responsible decisions in the Parliament of Romania and balanced and efficient budget execution at the level of all State institutions .
Parliament has also voted a number of reserves which , if maintained in the final budget , will have an adverse effect on budget execution .
In practice , this refers to the execution of the EU budget .
This is , of course , linked to the implementation and execution and to who we appoint as our representatives in the Commission and , of course , as leaders in the top posts that are now to be filled .
( PL ) Mr President , an analysis of the Court of Auditors &apos; annual report on budget execution for 2008 leads us to the conclusion that the situation is better than in previous years .
But the execution of their plans caused terrible suffering , far out weighing the benefits .
“ In resorting to this method of ascertaining the most auspicious day for putting his atrocious scheme into execution , Haman acted as the kings and nobles of Persia have always done , never engaging in any enterprise without consulting the astrologers , and being satisfied as to the lucky hour . ” — Jamieson ’ s Commentary , Vol .
And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided , but we would merely write it off as merely execution .
Now I &apos; d argue that that is as absurd as stating that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act , and nine months of gestation , and , God forbid , 24 hours of child labor is merely execution .
So these minimum snap trajectories in this flat space are then transformed back into this complicated 12 - dimensional space , which the robot must do for control and then execution .
&quot; It &apos; s only the execution of the written music , no interpretation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
It really is that simple in concept , though not in execution .
And in fact , what we need to do is see that as chapter one , celebrate it , close it , and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution , all about the how - to .
Madam President , coinciding with this year &apos; s first part - session of the European Parliament , a date has been set , unfortunately for next Thursday , in Texas in America , for the execution of a young 34 year - old man who has been sentenced to death . We shall call him Mr Hicks .
The condemned sometimes await their execution for many years in American prisons .
I must particularly highlight the threat of execution hanging over Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu - Jamal who are both victims of the machinations of a police force and legal system riddled with racism . In truth , they have both been condemned to death for their political ideas .

For that reason even the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights asked for time to re-examine the case and to be able to issue an opinion , and it also asked that no date be set for an execution .
Secondly , it is important because this is the only case since executions resumed in 1977 in which the evidence of unsolved , unadjudicated crime in a foreign country has been used to secure the death sentence .
In this case it is particularly important because it is a federal execution and will be the first since 1963 .
That is why we urge President Clinton to grant clemency in this case and a moratorium on federal executions .
In a presidential campaign executions , regrettably , become a political football in the US .
We do not hesitate to sign trade agreements with China , a totalitarian country if ever there was one , which ordered 1800 executions last year alone - that is the official total - and at the same time , we allow ourselves to pass judgement on the Tunisian government with what is , to my mind , uncalled for severity .

Mr President , in 1999 , eighty - five percent of all executions took place in only five countries : China , Iran , Saudi Arabia , the Democratic Republic of Congo and the United States .
Burma has been a Member of ASEAN for a number of years and there is absolutely no evidence to date that shows any improvement or an end to forced labour or executions or suppression of free speech and free movement .
Firstly , with regard to Myanmar , my colleague Chris Patten has already condemned before this House the constant violations of human rights by the military regime in Burma : executions without trial , the widespread imposition of forced labour , the enforced uprooting of local populations , hundreds of political prisoners in the country &apos; s prisons and the clear hindering of the free functioning of political parties .
The circumstances surrounding the execution at the beginning of this year of a Vietnamese - Canadian citizen undoubtedly support our convictions in this regard .
Moreover , the recent executions force us to revisit the conditions for European aid .
However , it also noted , with concern , continuing difficulties with regard to the restriction of freedoms , the use of executions and torture and discrimination directed against religious minorities and women .
Among recent forms of human rights violations , the instances of disappearance or extrajudicial execution , often preceded by torture , are particularly despicable .
We are well aware that the situation in Turkish prisons means we can not ignore the violence and intransigence of certain prisoners and the fact that , in some cases , the Turkish authorities had lost control of whole sections of the prisons , as well as the constant reports from various authoritative sources of summary executions of prisoners who have tried to detach themselves from the organisations they belong to , and lots being drawn to select which prisoners are to fast until death .
The European Union has intervened with the Palestinian Authority in connection with the death sentences recently carried out . The Union has also intervened in Israel to condemn the extra-judicial executions of Palestinians , corroborated by military sources .
Let me be equally clear , we are also deeply concerned by the killing of Israeli civilians by Palestinians and by the recent executions of Palestinians .
Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have condemned the execution .

For example , scientists are disturbed by the recent revelation that the majority of measurable earthquakes in California occur along hidden faults — in many cases in areas that geologists formerly considered to be relatively free of earthquake danger .
Nevertheless , their studies have identified active earthquake faults beneath folded arches of rock , many of which have been exploited for their trapped stores of oil .
Why have these underground faults been able to elude discovery , and just how much of a threat do they pose ?
These seemingly harmless folds with their buried active faults become earthquakes - in - the - making before seismologists have a chance to detect them .
The January 17 , 1994 , Northridge earthquake in the Los Angeles area is one recent example of what a hidden fault can do .
Scientists suspect that hidden faults are the cause of a number of major earthquakes , not only in California but also in Algeria , Argentina , Armenia , Canada , India , Iran , Japan , New Zealand , and Pakistan .

This is a hugely ambitious goal and 2010 seems a long way away but , considering the time frames for the various changes to structure and infrastructure , we can say that we are already extremely behind .
Besides , the flexible approach of a framework directive is also in keeping with the policy of increased self - regulation , to which priority should be given , but on two conditions : first , there must be a general time frame within which interested parties are required to agree and , secondly , there must be a common framework for determining who is responsible for honouring the obligations provided for in self - regulation .

We propose to you a five - year programme in which Europe ’ s development of the Lisbon strategy is placed within a time frame as specific as the one devised when we duly created the internal market in 1992 .
Several of the proposed amendments , however , go beyond the scope of the Commission ’ s proposal , especially as far as the time - frame for the proposal is concerned .
The other issues concern the extension of the time frame to four years and the possibility of quota transfer to the new Member States .
It retains its special status in the frame of the Community method , but all the policies need to be better integrated in a coherent foreign policy concept .
There is also a need to ensure that what is currently being developed within this frame of reference and will subsequently form a very considerable body of soft law , at least at the European level , and have an impact on all legislation in the field of civil law is not simply created without any involvement on the part of the legislative institutions , namely Parliament and the Council .
They are already preparing a new &apos; frame &apos; to cover Chernobyl .
It is therefore vital to us that we obtain not only the bare bones of a frame of reference , applying exclusively to issues of consumer contract law , but a framework including , in principle , all aspects of civil law .
This does not mean immediately , because some cases are complicated , but within a time frame that can be considered appropriate .
Thanks to the joint efforts of the Finnish Presidency , whose perseverance and high - quality work I commend , of the Commissioner and the relevant departments of the Commission and of Parliament , working together in an excellent spirit of cooperation and fully focused on the defined goals , we have reached the stage at which we can launch the Seventh Framework Programme within the desired time frame .
There is no other frame of reference for the solution to the problem of Kosovo and we must not , under any circumstances , forget that the European Union offered the countries of the Western Balkans and Serbia in particular firm and unequivocal European prospects , and we must work with the parties to that end also .
Perhaps the best frame for such a democratic reflection would be early elections .
It is all very well to have laws that dictate that the 30 - day time frame must not be exceeded , but how are SMEs supposed to implement them ?
It merits attention that the Parliament has , in its various resolutions on this matter , repeatedly acknowledged the benefits an improved contract law framework has on the Internal Market , has further welcomed the idea of a common frame of reference , and has insisted on close involvement of itself and the stakeholders concerned .

Later , it was improved on by the New York firm of Steinway &amp; Sons , whose frame , developed in 1855 , has been the model for all successive pianos up to the present time .
Over the frame are strung some 240 steel strings of various lengths and gauges , the shortest and thinnest at the treble or right - hand end and the longest and heaviest — the bass strings — on the left .
The strings are held by “ hitch pins ” on the curved side of the frame and are attached to tuning pins along the front of the piano , just in front of the player .
The strings exert a pressure of almost twenty tons on the frame .
So no matter how long the days might prove to be , Ge 1 verses 1 and 2 describe things already accomplished , and they fall outside any time frame encompassing the creative days .

Into this watery mixture another worker dips a large , fine sieve fitted in a stiff wooden frame .
As the frame is lifted , the water drains away , leaving the fine fibers on the sieve to mat together to form a sheet of washi .
The pattern thus formed is more than beautiful ; according to Wootton , it is similar to the lattice girders and space frames that structural engineers use to increase strength and rigidity .
Within a few yards &#91; meters &#93; of the body were objects that had apparently been a part of his every day life : an unstrung yew - wood bow , a buckskin quiver with 14 arrows ( 2 ready for use , the others still to be finished ) , a flint - bladed dagger , an ax , an object that is thought to be the frame for a primitive pack , a leather bag , a birch - bark receptacle , and fragments of clothing , as well as other utensils and objects .

The frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk , while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks : the filament and the sticky droplet .
This is the silk that &apos; s used to make the frame and radii of an orb web , and also the safety trailing dragline .
We think that &apos; s because the dragline silk , which is used to make the frame and radii for a web , needs to be very strong .
The costs of running the institution mean that you can not take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame .
So , they got the frames from these big bikes , put them together with the gears from the racing bikes , got the brakes from motorcycles , and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients .

And yet simply by changing the frame of reference it reveals so much , including what ended up being the TED Prize .
Here we have our device in which we put in a frame .
And then with four screws , we put in a frame , then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes , to the epileptic focus , the origin of the epilepsy , where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure .
I am also very aware of the remarks made about education , about training in the interpretation of images and about making younger people more aware of the need to approach the media in a critical frame of mind and not to watch any old thing , at any time and in any way .

Of course such a notion has superficial appeal , but if it leads to the appointment of at least 20 additional officials without a clear prospect of direct efficiency gains it should be resisted .
It is thought that , for the EU , China &apos; s accession to the WTO will signal an enormous gain in enforceable rights , with no significant change in the EU &apos; s own commitments towards China .
These gains have been achieved even though important gaps remain within the legal framework .
It is true that the increase in known reserves of oil in Angola points to a very interesting future for the next years and the question of licensing and who gets what gain from the large potential of oil production in Angola needs to be followed up very carefully .
Inside is part of our so - called productivity gain programme , which was introduced in 2002 as part of the reform .
Of course these productivity gains can be drawn already on this example .
In my view this is a very important gain in flexibility .
Fraud represents not just unlawful gain to the criminal , it represents the policies forgone because of the shortage of public resources ; it represents the policies that the Commission could have had without an increase in own resources ; the policies that the Member States could have pursued without increasing taxation rates .
That is an average gain of 3.7 pounds per day .
In spite of Vatican support for the political party it favored , Communist candidates made the largest gains nearly everywhere .
Also requests the Secretary - General to include in the report referred to in paragraph 5 of the present section information on economy and efficiency gains envisaged in the context of language posts ;
Another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the 21st century , we want to get away from the idea that power &apos; s always zero sum -- my gain is your loss and vice versa .
I therefore hope that all countries will join forces even more emphatically than in the past in order to find these paths of peace and dialogue and that nobody will try to seek political gain from such attacks .
On a final note , Mr President , the gains and losses of the EU &apos; s eastward enlargement should not be deciding factors .
So we will continue to need the support of this Parliament as we urge our Croatian friends to press on with these reforms , many of which will bring pain before the gains are evident .
Mr Sacconi &apos; s point was that we need the good examples of what economic gains can be made from complying with environmental legislation .
When as much , and even more , can be produced while reducing the required work and time input necessary , there is no reason for the gains of such modernisation to be appropriated by employers and for millions of people to lose their jobs .
We have done it elsewhere , at great gain to human health .
However , this also requires rules , and I wish to conclude by making that quite clear . Here , too , we must work together with the developing countries to ensure that rules are adopted which enhance the social benefits of the new technologies and are not simply targeted to commercial gain .
Numerous studies confirm it is perfectly safe , but we have to assume that most of these studies were funded by the industries which stand to gain from genetic engineering .
This committee was set up and started work in September 2000 and published its final report in October 2002 , in which it points out that high - ranking political , military and business figures in Uganda , Rwanda and Zimbabwe , as well as the Congo , are plundering the natural - mainly mineral - wealth of the Congo on a massive scale for personal gain or , in the case of Rwanda , for their country &apos; s benefit .
Furthermore , we can not accept your stand on maintaining in the public sector the burden of transport infrastructure costs for safety reasons - which are absolutely obvious - abandoning financial gain to private companies .
The gains have been estimated to be worth ten times the money invested , and that is good to hear .
Where regulation is needed is where the gains from remedying market failure for citizens or the environment outweigh the costs of government intervention .
We did not want ridiculous budgetary criteria to be imposed , or accounts of benefactors ’ sacrifices and beneficiaries ’ gains ; what we wanted from the policy was for it to promote cooperation and the transfer of means , with mutual respect and benefits for all .
Nobody should underestimate the huge potential gains and benefits for us in Europe of such a relationship growing and being soundly based .
Obviously , tourism and terrorism do not mix and as an area meant to be emerging for good from the dark shadow of terrorism , we in Northern Ireland are beginning , I am glad to say , to see a steady gain from increased tourism .
In summary , the Commission believes that , given the relatively small environmental gain that would result from advancing the deadline for the phase - out , the case for a change is not justified .
Likewise , we can not support amendments that change the threshold for the global warming potential from 150 to 50 , since this would in our view be determining the technology that the industry has to apply for little environmental gain .
Any reduction in the developed countries ’ commitments concerning the implementation of the Doha agenda would bring a substantial reduction in the possible gains for the developing countries .
Although a joint committee must ensure that the people of the Western Sahara will benefit from this agreement , it is very much in doubt whether the Saharan people actually stand to gain .
But , more importantly , the negotiations have had key outcomes , non-financial gains that add value and will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future budgets .
I welcome your commitment to better regulation , President - in - Office , but as you have heard today the biggest gain in better regulation will be to stop the European Parliament wandering around Europe , so that we can better focus on legislation .
There have been no noticeable gains for least - developed nations .
However , it is the stand - off on agriculture , which represents only a fraction of trade for developing and developed countries alike , that is preventing the Doha negotiations from addressing trade in manufacturing and services , which is where the vast bulk of the potential economic gains from this round lie .
End user gains are not demonstrated by the quality - price ratio .
To put it clearly , Germany , more than almost any other country , gains extensive benefits from the European internal market or an enlarged European internal market , but it is very difficult to make this clear to those concerned if the loss of their jobs was facilitated with European funds or if unlawful national subsidies were used for this .
Instead of costs , we really should be talking about gains for the European Union .
Economic research has shown that national economies stand to make large gains from the introduction of competition into the electricity market , but in that case it is important to break up vertical integration structures .
There are also States that systematically adapt their tax systems so that less well - off sections of the population can obtain net gains from tax cuts , instead of tax cuts only benefiting those in the more prosperous population groups .
I consider it essential that the Scottish parliament gains full powers in those areas currently reserved to London ; when that happens , I am confident that Scotland will feature amongst the Member States implementing measures for the benefit of consumers and businesses .
in writing . - I very much regret that , during the vote on autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan , Parliament agreed to reduce the length of the benefits to one year , thus reducing significantly any gain to Pakistan .
Implementation of that concept can create a new , real industrial revolution in the branch , with incalculable gains for Europe , but none of this will become a reality without effort and constructive cooperation by all those involved in the branch .
And if ever an exception has to be made to this principle , it must never be for the sake of an individual &apos; s interest , gain or privilege , but rather , because higher principles demand it - principles such as the maintenance of the democratic system , to quote the ultimate example .
If not , it would have been very easy for you to produce evidence to show that such and such would be the repercussions , such and such would be the tax gains .
We are addicted to the pursuit of profit and economic gain .
Already in Northern Ireland , a product - Soltron - is in use which has had immediate results in combating poisons emitted . If we are to make progress as fast as possible in our efforts to improve Community health , we should be creating an incentive for the use of this product in order that a major health gain can be made .
He willingly died for humankind in expression of his deep love and would , therefore , never tolerate anyone as his representative who would seek to exploit others for personal gain .
We accept this for the individual hunter consuming or passing on the game he has shot or caught .
Thirdly - apart from the question of game , which I will mention briefly in passing , with regard to which a balanced solution appears to have been found - there is training .
Trained hunters already take full responsibility for the healthy state of the game which they provide and will continue to do so in future .
Also , regarding the formation of gas in the gastro - intestinal tract , you will be aware that hunters eviscerate the game immediately as a food safety precaution and I do not see how the inspecting or official vet can therefore monitor the presence of gas in the gastro - intestinal tract .
Mr President , the severe forest fires which broke out in Portugal this year also affected agricultural and urban areas , destroying houses , factories , schools , power grids , telephone networks and other installations . They caused the deaths of eighteen people , stripped families of their homes and possessions , killed game and livestock , and deprived about 45 000 people of their wages and income .
Everyone is jostling to get hold of a note ; the Convention draft is being dealt with as if a piece of game were being hunted to death so that everyone can pull out a piece for themselves .
Persecution of this kind is equivalent to hunting Pygmies with the sole aim of treating them like common game , and it is an extremely serious problem .
It was also necessary to eliminate the legal uncertainty with regard to the scope of the regulation concerning by - products from wild game .
I also think that the uncertainty previously caused by the provisions on animal by - products from wild game has been eliminated .
Madam President , we ourselves are both for the game and for the hunters , without seeing any paradox .
They no longer dare to eat game which has been deformed by pollution , and they are themselves exposed to radiation which is making the death rate from cancer , among other things , alarmingly high .
When Europeans first visited North America this continent was more profusely populated with wild game and fur - bearing animals than any other part of the earth .
When the trapper found a territory that he felt would yield plenty of game , he would usually put up a log cabin in the center from which to work .
The sling was also used for hunting small game , both in the Transvaal and in Rhodesia .
Harvesting of the giant kelp is regulated by the California State Fish and Game Commission .
The successful hunter learns to recognize every sign of game , he learns to interpret these signs properly in their setting and he learns to use these signs to hunt down his quarry .
He comes to know the feeding habits of various kinds of game , the meaning of all the different sounds he hears and whether they are of immediate concern in realizing his objective .
Only the novice or tenderfoot just walks around until the game jumps out in front of him .
Just as we can not expect to take in knowledge and retain it without fully digesting it , neither can we grasp the full significance of discipline and training , applying it wisely , without honestly meditating upon it , considering the facts in the light of the scriptures presented , just as the skilled hunter keeps adding up evidences of game to lead in an unerring trail .
But at some point , they banded together to hunt bigger game .
A group of hunters approach , their packs loaded with wild game .
NW : OK , before I continue , I think it &apos; s important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat . Bush meat is the hunting of wild game .
Children are also great consumers of the Internet and video games .
According to the current rules , companies within the EU which sell music , computer games , software and services distributed electronically are taxed within the EU if these are bought by consumers within the EU .
The report , which analyses the Commission &apos; s evaluation report , is primarily concerned with the Internet and with video games , as it was felt important not to anticipate a possible future review of the Television without Frontiers directive .
We agree , too , that we have to provide parents with the right tools to enable them , together with their children , to assess which TV programmes , computer games , and films are the right ones for their children , and in order to support them in their judgment of the programmes .
Finally , I should like to urge the European Commission to encourage the Member States to continue to pay attention to evils which are distributed via television , video games and films .
Having said this , I would like to express my total support for the rapporteur when he calls on Member States to classify video games using self - regulatory mechanisms set up by the industry , and for them to establish &apos; abuse departments &apos; .
Secondly , it is not standards harmonised on a Europe - wide basis that we need , but Europe - wide minimum standards , particularly for video games and the Internet , in order to offer young people real protection .
A technical working group , chaired by my services , has established that an increasing range of products such as DVDs , video games , flowers , contact lenses , books , other printed matter and CDs are imported regularly from third countries .
Now , I am old enough to say that , when I was young , we did not have all these video games that exist today – we did not just sit in front of computer screens and enjoy ourselves like that – so we need to encourage young people to get out and get some exercise in order to try to prevent a situation from arising later on in life that none of us would want .
There is a classification system with labelling for the content of films , and also for games and videogames , that may be of use .
In 2003 , a European self - regulation system , known as Pan- European Game Information , was adopted in order to help parents choose when buying videogames intended for minors .
With regard to the content of games or videogames that can be found on the Internet , in contrast , there are systems out there , but they are applied and implemented at the initiative of certain respected consortia .
Since then , the Council Presidency has drafted a questionnaire , the purpose of which is to summarise the legal position in the Member States as regards media - specifically videos , computer games and films - that glorify violence .
What is more , all computer games come with descriptions of their content in terms of discrimination , drugs , bad language , sex and nudity , violence and elements that may be frightening or horrific .
I am thinking of video games , where sex and violence are legion ; I am thinking of drugs and other psychotropic substances that put each consumer into a state of trance ; and I am thinking of alcohol which , when consumed in excess , causes enormous damage , not least through its effect of ridding people of their inhibitions .
For some products , such as MP3 players , DVD players and computer game consoles , the consumer is obliged to accept very strict conditions in the small print , and in some cases this verges on the illegal and violates the right to privacy .
Children these days spend much of their time in front of the television , video games and computers .
In a time when children prefer to play computer games , there is a growing need to promote active , healthy lifestyles for children and young people .
If we are to be serious about combating child obesity , if we are serious about improving child health and if we are serious about getting children away from video games and into sport , we must provide better facilities for physical education in all schools and ensure that the teachers have the specialist knowledge to teach the subject .
We are among experts here so perhaps there is no need in this Chamber to list all the urgent problems that need to be tackled : from the marketing of violent video games to the rise in cases of international kidnapping of minors , the red tape that makes international adoptions difficult , the tragedy of the child soldiers , child labour , the failure to register the birth of a child , the remarkable number of disappeared children of which no more is ever heard .
The first experience with it in Germany , under the German Presidency , mainly related to Internet abuse and violent video games .
Everything from banning violence on TV and the sale of violent computer games to forced marriages , illegal adoptions and illegal work is covered in this report .
Apart from that the report is much too broad , because the title says &apos; marketing and advertising &apos; , when it also concerns school books , TV , the Internet , video games and much else besides .
Paragraph 14 of the text takes the biscuit , advocating the elimination of what it calls &apos; messages conveying gender stereotypes &apos; from textbooks , toys , video games , the Internet and advertising .
A computer game can not replace talking to one &apos; s grandmother .
Video games are now the favourite recreational activity of young people in Europe and beyond .
Many video games are in fact aimed at adults , with content that is in many cases unsuitable for children .
Taking account , therefore , of the Commission Communication of 22 April 2008 on the protection of consumers , in particular minors , in respect of the use of video games , there is an urgent need to regulate labelling and use measures such as providing a &apos; red button &apos; or the PEGI online system , included in the European Safer Internet programme .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the Manders report on the protection of consumers , in particular minors , in respect of the use of video games .
&quot; With his trademark piechart head and onomatopoeic &quot; &quot; paku paku &quot; &quot; chomp , Pac - Man looms large in the history of the modern video game . &quot;
14 : 00 to 16 : 00 video games .
Seckilling is a term from video games , while in the online shopping world it vividly describes fighting among buyers : you win or lose all in a matter of seconds .
Thus , indignation has made the rounds , and one after another , brave militants of the Web have felt obligated to cry scandal and ask the military brass to do something to punish the man whose choice of scarf design made him look like Ghost , a character wearing a similar - looking balaclava in the “ ultraviolent ” video game , Call of Duty … .
&quot; A traditional Iñupiaq story called Kunuuksaayuka told by Robert Nasruk Cleveland and documented in the book &quot; &quot; Stories of the Black River People &quot; &quot; has now taken a new life in the form of a video game for PC and other popular gaming consoles . &quot;
&quot; Reviews continue to come in , and Roy Boney writes in the Native Peoples blog that Never Alone &quot; &quot; is more than a typical video game . &quot;

Some child educators even say that ‘ video games are a seductive menace and are capable of encouraging a violent , reclusive behavior in children . ’
One child may get addicted to an electronic game , but another may not .
Certain computer games allure children into unlimited withdrawal from reality , and a number get addicted to them .
For example , in my first TEDTalk , I did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games .
A recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real - life relationships with them .
For me that meant no reading , no writing , no video games , no work or email , no running , no alcohol , no caffeine .
So , one thing I found early on , when I started doing computer games , is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception .
We hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills , or we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean , or we can have swarms of our machines controlled by multi-player video game engines to control many of these machines , to monitor coral reefs or to monitor fisheries .
Let me give you an example of this . The year is 1976 , and Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise .
Spacewar ! is built , the first computer game , and all of a sudden , interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out .
You can play computer games , you can sleep , you can read on the way .
Students love that TDP . They think it &apos; s the name of a video game .
I &apos; m going to talk about a technology that we &apos; re developing at Oxford now , that we think is going to change the way that computer games and Hollywood movies are being made .
Now , before I talk more about that technology , let &apos; s have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games .
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game .
It &apos; s not something you get in computer games at the moment , at all .
Now , at this stage , it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds .
The thing that really amazes me is that , today , people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist inside video games .
And in this video game , there were two really big dragons , and you had to team up to kill them -- 42 people , up to 42 to kill these big dragons .
Now the staggering system , not just that this worked in EverQuest , but that today , a decade on , every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system -- tens of millions of people .
A protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years was solved was by three players in a matter of days , perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game .
&quot; And David and I discovered that we had a question in common , that we really wanted the answer to , and that was , &quot; &quot; Why hasn &apos;t anybody built any computer games for little girls ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
So David and I decided to go find out , through the best research we could muster , what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer , to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games .
Peter Molyneux demos Milo , a hotly anticipated video game for Microsoft &apos; s Kinect controller . Perceptive and impressionable like a real 11 - year - old , the virtual boy watches , listens and learns -- recognizing and responding to you .
But for me , this is a wonderful opportunity where technology , at last , can be connected with , where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game &apos; s concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you &apos; re watching a film or a book .
And we put that wall around the World Church of God , and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army .
I wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand , say , quantum theory , if we brought up children to play computer games , beginning in early childhood , which had a sort of make - believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen , a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer &apos; s make - believe , so that they became familiar on the Middle - World scale of the stream .
And , similarly , a relativistic computer game in which objects on the screen manifest the Lorenz Contraction , and so on , to try to get ourselves into the way of thinking -- get children into the way of thinking about it .
It &apos; s true . Ninety percent of children do play video games .
Well , I &apos; m not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health .
There &apos; s not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you , right ? You &apos; re all bombarded with that .
What we do in the lab is actually measure directly , in a quantitative fashion , what is the impact of video games on the brain .

With its proposal to establish a committee of inquiry , an alliance of Greens and of Members from the Left and Right of the political spectrum clearly want , however , to use Parliament as an arena for James Bond - style games .
When basic factors such as respect of the Balkan borders are missing , when we play games with Montenegro and Kosovo , when this is coupled with the antagonism being shown towards the Milosevic regime , I think we are already undermining every positive effort we should be making .
I would just like to say , Mr President , that some strange selectivity is being practised here , that certain Members stage little acts and , after the act is finished , they leave and the game is over .

For five years , I have been witness to how , here , in the European Parliament , a specific group of people , recruited from all political groups , but mainly from the Greens and the Socialists , have been whipping up unprecedented hysteria about the climate .

You have the green for example , that corresponds to tactile information , or the blue that corresponds to auditory information .
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position , I really must object , because quite simply , it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern , low - consumption cars such as the 3 - litre car , which contain a great deal of plastic , by means of rigid , high recycling quotas !
Consequently , we can not support Amendment No 2 of the Greens , as borne out in the committee meeting .
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43 , tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens &apos; Amendment No 105 .
The Danish Members of the Group can not vote in favour of the proposal but will , on the contrary , be supporting a number of amendments , especially those tabled by the Greens .
Let us point out that Parliament &apos; s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance supported them .
But I must say that despite the scare - mongering of the Greens , it has to be emphasised that ISA can not under any circumstances be transmitted to humans , and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said , that the virus can not survive above 25 o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold - water species .
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed .
For this reason , our Group rejects the amendments which have been resubmitted by Mr Blokland , the Greens and others .
That is why the Greens are supporting very strongly this resolution from the Environment Committee .
We are therefore delighted that , in its motion for a resolution , Parliament has taken up the proposal tabled by the Greens to the effect that we , as a Parliament , should submit a complaint to the Patent Office in Munich and that Parliament should join us in our criticism of the structural problems of the European Patent Office , because if transparency and an ethical approach are to be allowed to come into their own , we require independent supervision of the European Patent Office .
Unfortunately , the Greens did not nominate him again for the Bundestag , but he is right nonetheless , which is why we have tabled a motion stating that we should keep an eye on these risks but not totally ban genetic transfer .
However , I am a little confused because the Greens in this House are maintaining that the common position is so weak that it is imperative that we make a huge number of improvements to it .
Now this is a case of either or : either our Parliament decides this measure is not a good one , which would mean abandoning it - even in 2009 - or , like the Greens , it must admit that such lists are vital if we want to create real families of thought in Europe , in which case this important political debate can begin by the time of the 2004 elections .
By the way , I think it is a shame that the Greens are not taking part in this debate and also highlighting these aspects .
I therefore appeal to the Greens to withdraw this point , failing which I would recommend that you vote against it , so as to ensure consistency with the rest of the decision .
If that was such a terrible thing , the Greens should have opposed it at the time .
The Greens are quite simply wrong to criticise the TENs as benefiting only the central and most densely populated states .
It is the same puritanical streak shared by Robespierre , Pol Pot , the Greens and the Quakers .
The Greens want to ban many of the more than 600 additives in cigarettes .
It attracted a broad consensus but I fear that this consensus will not perhaps hold up if all the amendments proposed by the Greens are included .
The Greens &apos; proposed amendments contain a discussion of the content , not the form of asylum law .
Mr Schulz has reproached us Greens on the same count .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Greens wanted the joint resolution of this House to specifically consider the illegality of the election of Mr Fujimori as President of Peru and to ask that fresh elections be organised .
The joint resolution which will be proposed to you and to which the Greens have not put their names , merely highlights the irregularities and concludes that these challenge the legitimacy of this election .
Mr President , I want to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on my own behalf and on behalf of the Greens , for this report provides a very good overview of how the Cohesion Fund has operated and of the work that was done in the course of 1998 .
I should like to begin by saying that this is an exceptionally good maiden report by our new colleague Mrs Hieronymi , who also did a truly first - class job in hammering out compromises in committee with our Socialist colleagues and with the Greens and Liberals .
I would just like to point out that the committee approved this report almost unanimously , with only one abstention , and all the political groups , from the PPE to the PSE to the Greens , contributed to improving it .
Not all Greens and EFA members in our group - the non-federalists - would support Mr Dupuis &apos; amendments , because we believe that they are moving in the same direction and we would have grave reservations about that .
We are pleased , however , that the Greens have achieved a great breakthrough when it comes to emissions of dangerous substances , which now have to be identified on the list of priority substances .
Mr President , I should like to begin by saying that all Members of this House care deeply about the environment despite the fact that the rapporteur and members of the Greens would have you believe otherwise .
In my opinion , the difference between the views of the Christian Democrats and the Greens on the one hand and the Social Democrats and Liberals on the other hand is that the former emphasise the penal implications for the medical profession , whilst the latter focus on the need for further research into the effects .
From this perspective , I have been able to support the alternative put forward by the Social Democrats and Liberals rather than that put forward by the Christian Democrats and Greens which goes for all - out rejection .
I am disappointed that Parliament has neither understood nor tried to understand the message of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and of the Greens , who have tried to draw attention to the underhand way in which the executive committee acted in order to water down the issue of GMOs in its reports so that we will end up with vast amounts of them on our plates and in our glasses .
No , I have not got the wrong debate . The Greens are perfectly in tune with public opinion and consumers , who are concerned about future food products .
The Greens are in tune with wine growers , producers and merchants who are worried about the introduction of GMOs into vine plants .
I would just like to remind certain people that the Greens were indeed alone when , at the top of their voices , they called for the reform of the CAP .
We think our friends on the Left and the Greens are asking too much in this regard .
The Greens do not support the compromise text drawn up by our fellow delegates in connection with Amendment No 19 .
I , too , find it quite hard to understand the criticism voiced by the Liberals and the Greens because classification is exactly what we need to achieve openness .
I am delighted that this constitutes such an important part of her report because it is based on the analysis - which , if I am honest , has been made by the Greens before now , and on more than one occasion - that the European Union &apos; s strength resides in its ability to prevent conflicts , and that we will only have to be able to seek recourse to military means - sadly - as a last resort .
We protest against this imperialist military policy all the more given that a declared consensus on the issue holds sway in this Chamber , with acceptance of and open support for this policy on the part of the vast majority of groups , from the extreme right to the Greens and the Socialists .
The Greens are in favour of the report as adopted in committee .
At the time the Liberals and Greens tried , but the members of the People &apos; s Party and the Socialists were not in favour , in order not to affect the judicial process .
I say that in the knowledge that these are foundational beliefs for the parties of the European Free Alliance and for the Greens in this House .
Secondly , we will not accept Amendment No 6 either , with which the Greens are once again trying to start another sham debate , namely on a general speed limit of 120 km / h . We already have speed limits on most European roads .
Mr President , I should like to explain why the Greens were in favour of these proposed amendments .
That is why the Greens voted in favour of it .
There is not one party here that has the exclusive right to ethical principles and nor is there one party which can address the other , the Liberals , the Greens and the Socialists , under the heading of human rights violations .
The Greens , you may have noticed , confined themselves to proposed amendments which relate solely to the rightholder - I refer to Amendments Nos 34 and 36 . Perhaps , you will say , they anticipated future contracts .
In the conciliation , it was , in particular , we in the Group of the European United Left , together with the Greens , who fought for the improvements which have now in fact been made , for example the gradual elimination of antibiotic - resistant markers , greater transparency and better risk assessments .
Mr President , Commissioner , now that the Greens are finally in clover , does it not make sense to choose the much easier path through the whole complicated premium structure by going for a climate - related grassland premium and forgetting the rest ?
The European Greens have a clear attitude towards liberalisation .
Even if this is not specified in the directives before us , censorship and the supervisory authorities &apos; quest for more and more control over people appears increasingly to be the essence of any attempt to shape the digital sector , which is why it must be said here that we Greens are in favour of open access for everyone .
It will be no surprise to anyone that the Greens will vote against this agreement , as we do with all third - country fisheries agreements .
The Greens are voting against this agreement , as we do with all third - country agreements .
Can the Group of the Greens count on his support if we submit a proposal to that effect ?
They want us to believe that the transport of radioactive materials is not a matter for the nuclear industry and that we , the Group of the Greens , are in the wrong debate .
Despite this , we will be supporting those amendments , for the Greens , too , have now grown up .
I wonder if it is maybe being unnecessarily demonised , to provide an enemy that the Greens can use in their campaigns .
Madam President , I explained most of my considerations on this report yesterday , but , this morning , I would like to add that the desires and expectations of the left , of the Greens and of Mrs Roth - Behrendt are , in my opinion , destined to remain just desires and expectations .
In all events , we the Greens shall not do so ; instead we shall back the right of the people who wish to consume these substances to decide for themselves .
If that is the intention behind the amendment , we in the Group of the Greens are totally opposed to it .
With regard to this second report , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance deeply regrets that , out of 70 substances , only two are to be banned , when breast milk is sometimes contaminated with chemical substances from these products , such as brominated products , to levels which exceed WHO standards .
However , I must say that I am somewhat disappointed that the Greens have moved to reject the supplementary budget .
I would have expected him to be closer to us , now that we know that the Greens have tabled a proposed amendment rejecting this supplementary and amending budget .
I should particularly like to express my appreciation - and for me as a democrat this was a cheering sight yesterday - of the fact that after yesterday &apos; s tumult four conscientious groups immediately realised their responsibility for Europe - the Christian Democrats , the EPP , the Socialists , the Liberals and the Greens - and sought a way out of the situation .
I would call on the Greens , the Liberals and the Christian - Democrats to support this standard .
It beggars belief that this undemocratic attitude is being expressed here by the Irish Greens and by others .
We should support the proposed amendment by the Greens which still allows leftovers to be used but subject to stricter conditions .
I naturally defend the proportion , and that will be the largest proportion , of the Greens who will be voting against .
On all other scores - I repeat , all other scores - the Greens can accept a compromise in Bonn .
As a step in the right direction the Greens support the idea of penalties for those countries which are not observing their legally binding commitments to reduce fleets .
I would like to stress that the Group of the Greens rejects the pressure that inevitably leads to restricting its right to legislate , on the pretext of being efficient and swift , particularly because , as we all know , this dossier dates back a long way .
At this point I should like to thank the rapporteur and his team for resisting the attempts of the Greens , as well as those from the Left of this chamber , to have him write a cloak - and - dagger thriller .
If the House does not even accept the Greens &apos; amendment that seeks to establish fundamental human rights as a common minimum level of protection for everyone in the EU , the proposed recommendation must be rejected for the sake of those same fundamental rights .
I therefore applaud the amendment by the Group of the Greens , designed to place an immediate ban on the entire group of brominated flame retardants right now .
As other colleagues have pointed out , the lack of parliamentary scrutiny has made the Commission &apos; s proposals unacceptable and the Greens cannot , therefore , agree to the Commission &apos; s proposal on the expenditure for the research fund .
Although there is widespread support for some other oral amendments which I was going to make , I understand there is opposition from the Greens so the only oral amendment that I wish to make now concerns paragraph 14 .
It is not for the Commission , or this House , or the Greens , or Greenpeace to decide how a Directive should be applied ; that is the task of the relevant authorities .
The worst - case scenario of terrorist air attacks on nuclear power stations , long condemned by the Greens and anti-nuclear citizens , is becoming , through force of circumstance , a valid hypothesis .
This report therefore meets with the unreserved support of us Greens and regionalists .
Mr President , I should like to mention that the Greens and the Liberals have kindly invited everyone to their joint meeting this afternoon to meet His Holiness , the Dalaï Lama , at 3 p.m. in Room 100 in WIC - that means everybody who was not included in the invitation of the PSE and the PPE - DE .
Let me begin by saying that the Greens support the proposal of the Commission for both the FIFG and the MAGP .
I do not have much of a problem with that of my group , but we should take another good look at those by the Greens , for it makes no sense to go beyond what is stipulated in the Regulation .
The second opinion , formulated by Messrs Martin and Bonde , and included in the amendments tabled by the Greens , is that the EP has , in fact , created unnecessary , self - imposed restrictions by striking deals with the Commission and the Council and that we have sadly not yet seen a majority in favour of total public access in this Parliament .
This , in turn , impacts on the environment , it results in an excessive use of space and generates all kinds of additional problems which we as Greens are also being faced with to a considerable extent .
There are three issues of great concern to the Greens .
Australian Senate candidate Larissa Waters is very clear about what The Greens want :
Marine pilots should be compulsory for carriers navigating the entire inner Great Barrier Reef , and industry should bear the full cost of pollution clean ups , said the Greens today as an unknown amount of oil leaks from a coal carrier off Great Keppel Island .
Reef is not a coal highway – act to prevent oil spills say Greens
Both the Greens and the Social Democrats SPD are fighting for ownership of the issue – this seems to have been the driving force behind the parliamentary inquiry .
Gelatin , especially lime jello , is ideal for making salads , particularly when greens are not available .
Then we would send a crew after them by color — ‘ Bring a red , or a blue , or a green . ’
Now I want you to look at that dot between the green and the red . Okay ?
And then with four screws , we put in a frame , then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes , to the epileptic focus , the origin of the epilepsy , where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure .
It &apos; s so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens , from the defectors , the cheaters .
My fear - even if you shake your head , Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years , that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers .
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate - General for the Environment , where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women .
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand .
In addition , however , and very importantly , because it is a transition period , there will be training , there will be advice , there will be support , there will be assurances . The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition .
This reminds me of a Greek proverb : you can not chop off your head just because you have tooth ache .
When I was a young child , a library was opened in a village where I was born and brought up ; when the head teacher of the village school opened the library , he said that there were over 4 000 books in the library , and I thought with all the wisdom of a six - year old child : well , that is all the books in the world .
In particular I want to speak of the Isle of Wight , a beautiful island with 130 000 good people but 68 % GDP per head of the European average - a very poor region .
The American President or the head of the British secret service , who is not even known in Britain ?
There is absolutely no point in burying one &apos; s head in the sand and always maintaining the opposite of what is in fact the case , on the principle that the more you insist on something , the closer it comes to becoming a reality .
I come from a part of Wales , where GDP per head of the population is less than 75 % of the European Union average , in other words , an Objective 1 area .
It really scares me that - whenever I finish writing a story that has grown in my head - this sort of thing always seems to happen .
Doctors at a hospital in Qalat , capital of Zabul Province in southern Afghanistan , are treating a brutally tortured woman whose husband cut off both her ears and nose , broke her teeth and shaved her head only three months after their marriage .
The visit of the head of the Roman Catholic Church to Cameroon this March 2009 has ignited some Cameroonian bloggers to point the search lights on the political effects ( if any ) of a Papal visit to country like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Here an artist , an architect , a biologist and a technician worked together to resolve an existing problem , &quot; &quot; said Lakner , a Hungarian Algae working helmet on his head . &quot;
Thanks to a tweet by @ GoldenTent , I came across this link to the YouTube video , which alleges that Armenian oligarch and head of ruling Bargavatch Hayastan ( ‘ Properous Armenia ’ ) party Gagik Tsarukyan stages this fight between his lions and a donkey . ( or it was staged at his ‘ private zoo ’ )
One older Bengali coworker even expressed amazement that I followed the “ old - fashioned ” tradition of wearing a loha – a gold - plated iron bangle that serves as a wedding ring among Bengali women – on my left wrist daily ............. On the third hand ( yes , yes , I know ) , the last time I wore sindoor to the office , my boss wanted to know if I needed a band - aid for the cut on my head .
When I asked people if they knew my mom , they shook their heads until I mentioned her by her nickname , Tita .
&quot; With his trademark piechart head and onomatopoeic &quot; &quot; paku paku &quot; &quot; chomp , Pac - Man looms large in the history of the modern video game . &quot;
Many people , both here and abroad , are demanding the head of the WikiLeaks founder .
Can the girl see in the young man she plans to marry someone she can accept as her “ head , ” someone for whom she will always have “ deep respect ” ?
In the case of true midgets , everything about them in a physical way is ‘ mini ’ — their head , their body , their limbs , their physical strength — but not their mental and emotional powers .
Most people shrug their shoulders and shake their heads when encountering them .
Ages before engineers of ancient Rome constructed the dome atop the Pantheon , the dome of the human skull already roofed the human head .
There are those who may not think anything of pushing someone ’ s head down while one is drinking water from a fountain .
Were they taking a trifling view of these solemn activities , or had all this prominence gone to their heads , causing them to act with pride and ambition ?
The fact that the husband is to be “ head of his wife ” does not mean that his views on how matters are to be handled are the only ones that are of any consequence .
God has appointed the man as the head of the family and equipped him for it .
Hence , the wife should not attempt to usurp or undercut her husband ’ s position as head by disputing with him in front of the children .
AK : It has ears that move passively when the head goes .
It &apos; s got two people inside it on stilts , which give them the height , and somebody in the front who &apos; s using a kind of steering wheel to move that head .
He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand .
Each one of them operates either an ear , separately , or the head , up and down .
But he also controls the head directly by using his hand .
Or , when he &apos; s more relaxed , the head comes down and the ears listen , either side .
And then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death -- the mycelium is consumed by the ants , they become mummified , and , boing , a mushroom pops out of their head .
The design is there in nature , but it &apos;s not in anybody &apos; s head .
Now of course , your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully , so you might have trouble understanding what &apos; s going on .
At that time , it was the head of Caritas Germany .
He &apos; s got no body , no man , just a head floating high .
So from that day on , I was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land , but my head was down there , underwater .
What I &apos; m going to try and do now is to square , in my head , four two - digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators , even using the shortcut method .
OK , what I &apos; m going to try and do , is to square in my head a five - digit number requiring a 10 - digit calculator .
I &apos; ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head . Whoosh !
Alisa Miller , head of Public Radio International , talks about why -- though we want to know more about the world than ever -- the US media is actually showing less . Eye - opening stats and graphs .
And they sort of fly away , out of your head .
&quot; After referring to the black Africans as &quot; &quot; beasts who have no houses , &quot; &quot; he writes , &quot; &quot; They are also people without heads , having their mouth and eyes in their breasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
And if you look at them , the slate of the post -colonial leaders -- an assortment of military fufu heads , Swiss - bank socialists , crocodile liberators , vampire elites , quack revolutionaries .
Just consider the facts : we looked at Austria a while ago , but we can also look at the stock markets , Mr President : given that the euro , that great undertaking , has fallen 16 % against the dollar in a year , then perhaps , I will not say a government , but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues .
In your reply to Mr Dupuis &apos; question , you referred to the fact that the sanctions approved by the Heads of State and Governments of fourteen countries were bilateral in nature .
- ( SV ) As representatives of the Swedish Christian Democrats , who view enlargement towards the East as being clearly the most important issue for the EU , I wish to make the following remarks before the Heads of Government and State discuss the European Union &apos; s powers and forms of decision making at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .
Human rights issues are frequently discussed , as the speakers have noted , within the political dialogue which the Council is conducting with Tunisia within the Association Council and through the Heads of Mission of the Member States in Tunis who have regular meetings with the relevant Tunisian government officials in this area .
Before embarking on an explanation of my report , I would like to start by asking you a question that I can not get out of my head .
But it is important for the Heads of State and Government meeting at the Biarritz European Council to talk about it .
Turning to Mr Moscovici &apos; s questions : firstly , Mr President - in - Office , we are certainly not advocating running the risk of the Charter being rejected in Biarritz just because we are calling for it to be incorporated into the Treaties ; however , in all honesty , I can not imagine that responsible heads of government will reject the Charter , given the high quality of its content .
Consequently , should the Heads of State and Government say nothing at Nice , they would be leaving the door open to what others have called &apos; government by the judges &apos; .
Moreover , even the Heads of State and Government have not been able to reach agreement on this issue , and it is to be carried over to the forthcoming Nice Summit .
The growth of xenophobic and anti-democratic movements brings the issue of common European values to a head .
Is it not time that this issue was dealt with by the U.S. and European Heads of State and Government at the G7 summits ?
Your President will naturally have the opportunity to express the views of your institution on all these subjects and to discuss them with the Heads of State and Government .
The question is whether the Heads of State and Government of the European Union have been doing their homework too .
I also want to say to Giorgio Napolitano - who has done a lot of work on this issue - that in the end the atmosphere at Nice , the spirit of the Heads of State and Government , and the spirit of the Commission was not defensive of national interests , but seeking a common direction within those national interests .
Therefore , the problem of free movement of third - country nationals within the Schengen area will again rear its head and become even more acute .
Yet I did not want to wait until 2005 before telling the truth and asking the questions which have to be asked of the Commission proposals , when the time comes , by the Heads of State and Government and by Parliament .
Subject : Commission &apos; s conduct in regard to freedom of expression Former Commissioner Anita Gradin and the former head of her private office , Christer Asp , have been criticised in a letter from the Commission for having given public interviews to clarify how several million in aid intended for Bosnia under the ECHO programme could have disappeared .
I have a supplementary question concerning the Commission &apos; s Information Office in Stockholm and it s former head , Linda Steneberg .
With regard to the second question , the Head of my Private Office wrote with this request at the end of August , and I would like to make it clear that he did so on my instructions , as I myself was on an official visit to Poland .
And then another question popped into my head : why not also think about proper heating for people &apos; s houses in the North of the European Union , so that the old people there do not have to pay more for their heating than those in the South ?
This result shows a serious lack of understanding by public opinion in the Member States , which is due to the lack of transparency in the negotiations , the tortuous nature of the agreements concluded and the complexity of the issues relating to EU enlargement and the process of integration , all questions which have not really been discussed head - on with the citizens and therefore clarified .
When , according to researchers in the field , not even the Heads of State who took part in the negotiations are fully aware of the consequences of the Treaty of Nice , we might ask ourselves whether it is possible to reach a sensible decision on this issue at all .
On a proposal by the ministers of finance , the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB , Parliament can offer advice so as to enable the Heads of State and the Council to reach a decision .
I have , myself , done so repeatedly in conversations with the head of the Slovak government and with the Slovak parliament and press and also on public occasions in Slovakia .
The Heads of State and Government will thus have an opportunity to influence preparations , where necessary . They will also have the opportunity to discuss some of the more political aspects of the euro , such as the use of the euro in the candidate countries .
The Heads of State and Government will discuss enlargement because it is important to keep up the strongest possible political momentum for this project , whatever technical difficulties we encounter in relation to any particular aspect .
Today we wish Parliament to adopt an opinion on the decisions to be taken by the Heads of State and Government in Laeken , and I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues very sincerely for their cooperation on this issue .
For this reason , the Commission has given us a head start by means of this framework , and one with which we basically agree , in cases where we want to establish legal certainty on issues that we have openly debated and in cases where we want to declare the free market , competition in the market , to be a fundamental principle .
This , Mr President , is precisely the reason why the European Parliament has wanted not only to discuss , but also to adopt an own - initiative report in order to add fuel to the debate on the next summit , the second of the Heads of State and Government , which will take place next spring , and present a document that could offer a strategic vision with regard to these relations , in order that the European Union will not arrive at this summit empty handed , at least with regard to the responsibility of our institution .
On the substantive questions , let me tell you quite frankly that the truth is that we had already taken decisions on most of the aspects referred to by President Bush , during the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of 20 September ; these decisions were in fact supported by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Brussels on 21 September .
The issue of recognised partnerships will be discussed at the next meeting of the heads of administration of all EU institutions .
Various Members have referred to angels this morning - either to the sex of angels or to how many could dance on the head of a pin .
Mr President , Mr Napolitano has hit the nail on the head on this issue .
I understand perfectly well , therefore , that we placed this issue at the head of Monday &apos; s agenda , but I do not think this was what was intended , especially after last week &apos; s vote by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
I expect the Heads of Government will discuss this issue in Barcelona and that the European Union will be quick to make a statement on this .
Two years ago , at the Lisbon European Council , the Heads of State and Government wondered how Europe could deal with the enormous changes that our societies are currently facing as a result of globalisation and how we could respond to the challenges of a knowledge - based economy .
If the credibility of these spring economic summits is not to be undermined , then Prime Ministers must apply themselves to banging heads together to make sure their national ministers make progress on these issues .
I believe that is the most important issue which should be dealt with at the European Union / Latin American Summit of Heads of State .
Therefore , I believe that this issue , like all the issues relating to illegal immigration , is of concern to European society today and it is logical that the Heads of State and Government should deal with all aspects of them .
Finally , why does the Commission resist the proposal from the ACP heads of government in Fiji to enter an initial phase of negotiations on principles with the ACP Group as a whole ?
We will not solve these problems by burying our heads in the sand . Quite the opposite .
As you are aware , the key points that will be on the table in the debate between the Heads of State and Government relate to the financing of enlargement . These last remaining issues are nonetheless highly significant .
The very least that we need from the Heads of State and Government is an agreement permitting us , in the time between Brussels and Copenhagen , to get together with the candidate countries and properly sort out those financial and agricultural policy issues that are as yet unresolved .
I would therefore like to join those fellow MEPs who ask how the Commission , the Member States and the Heads of Government can help us in our duty to inform .
On no account should we allow budgetary discussions to be derailed by reopening issues that have been long settled , in particular , the continuation of the British budgetary abatement , which was agreed unanimously by heads of government at Berlin in 1999 .
I am very well aware that it is the discarding issue that rears its head here .
Commissioner Nielson , who is responsible for humanitarian issues in Europe , has not announced that he is to visit Chechnya , but rather that he is to attend a banquet for Heads of State and Government in St Petersburg .
I wish the summit of Heads of State and Government under Danish presidency great success , in order that we may tackle the issues that remain to be resolved .
The question to the Council went : Is the Council , at the level of Heads of State or Government , prepared to enter into a dialogue with the European Parliament about the circumstances for the adoption of the Statute of Members ?
That is a good thing in itself . However , the move by the head of the information policy division to Microsoft raises questions , as the official concerned was involved in the antitrust investigation into the company .
The fact is that two trains are going to collide head - on here , all because we are arguing about who is slightly more , or slightly less , to blame in this matter .
Therefore , we need our scientists to get their heads together on this and resolve it .
Following on from the conclusions of the European Council in Seville , the Presidency also intends to bring a series of issues concerning immigration , asylum and external borders which , as you know , were basic priorities of our Presidency , to the attention of the heads of state during the June Council .
However , on this extremely serious issue , the European institutions continue to suffer , so to speak , from an endemic reluctance across the board to address , head - on , the challenge represented by the activity of the criminal Mafia organisations which organise the despicable trafficking of human beings , which frequently causes tragedies such as those portrayed on television screens in the houses of all European citizens throughout the world , where a picture is painted which certainly discredits the European institutions as well .
There has been continual whining about the EU meddling in everything and being overly protective , and they have been asking when the Europolice are going to start lighting bonfires piled with dangerous cookery books and whether soon we will have to eat wearing a helmet on our head , just to be on the safe side .
The draft Constitution it has adopted will certainly be referred , under the Treaty , for final decisions by the Heads of State and Government , but it would be foolish to call into question the most significant innovations in it after sixteen months of hard work put in by the representatives from the governments , the national parliaments and the European Parliament .
We have given instructions to our heads of delegation in third countries to stress the importance of this issue .
In conclusion , I would say that faced with mounting criticism of the choices made in this field by Europe &apos; s Heads of State or Government , what matters now is to listen to the demands that people are making and not to go against them , unless we wish to see the people of Europe grow even more disaffected with the Union .
We do not therefore believe that we need to make proposals to modify this text ; we understand that many Members would have liked to have called for improvements on various points , but our approach has been that we should not call for any , but that we should ask the Heads of State or Government not to substantially undo or alter the broad consensus achieved in the Convention .
The Heads of State or Government will therefore have to come to a decision on it themselves when the Intergovernmental Conference opens .
The third point is one that must be faced head - on – the issue of the way in which the provisions on mergers are being brought closer to those in the Cartels Regulation .
It will then be up to Member States to decide whether to insist on specific , minority points , and , if necessary , to bring them to the attention of Heads of State or Government .
If there is any doubt about this , it is enough to try asking how many women there are among Heads of State or Government .
Nevertheless , no Member State has called into question the objective – which is also an imperative political need – of bringing the Intergovernmental Conference to a successful conclusion within the timeframe suggested at Thessaloniki and confirmed at Brussels in October by our Heads of State and Government .
The IGC ministerial meeting of 8 December 2003 and the bilateral meetings which the Presidency will be stepping up in the coming weeks will therefore have to concentrate , first and foremost , on the institutional issues in order to make the best possible preparation for the final Conference meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government scheduled to open on 12 December 2003 .
As far as the economic issues are concerned , in particular the objective of boosting sustainable economic growth , the European Council will mark the culmination of the long period of work that started with the Thessaloniki European Council and was further developed by the Heads of State or Government at the most recent Summit in October .
It goes no further than what we want for other areas , that being that decisions on specific technical issues should be capable of being taken by a simplified procedure , and that means that if the Heads of Government want to change something , they have to do so unanimously .
My worry is that we are leaving open many issues that will then be squeezed into the package for the Heads of State or Government , and that we will then end up with a repeat of this ‘ night of Nice ’ and its compromise , not merely on the lowest common denominator , but with a collection of compromises , completely unrelated and mutually contradictory .
Today , a good five months before the Members of this House bid one another a final farewell and head for the campaign trail , it is a question of identifying what is feasible and tackling this together , so that on such a decisive issue as protecting the Union ’ s financial interests we do not have to go before our electorate empty - handed .
I would , though , also like to thank the Commission , for in my many years in this House – almost twenty - five of them so far – never before has a Commission dared to put it s head as far above the parapet as this one when it comes to the safety of nuclear power stations and the safe disposal of radioactive waste .
We should like you to give us some clarification , a clear answer to the vital question that Parliament is asking you : do you intend to continue as head of the executive , or have you decided to stand in the forthcoming European elections ?
Those thoughts kept going through my head : They were tortured , but why were they killed ?
In a song titled “ Edward Sa ’ ed , ” Hdaib deals with the issue of Palestinian identity head on .
When making medical decisions , then , the individual patient and the family head bear the primary responsibility .
‘ In class the instructor called on me , and although I knew the answer , I played dumb and shook my head no , and then felt like a dog .
She questioned them and was told that the inscription on her T - shirt was a message in Chinese that read : “ I am a bald coconut - head baboon .
What serious question should be asked of each family head , and what will be the results of his neglect ?
For what purpose is the question of head covering discussed at this time ?
So , in the following issue of The Watchtower , we will consider some of the circumstances where the question of head covering might arise , so that faithful women ministers in the New World society will know how to act appropriately in harmony with the Scriptures and with a good Christian conscience .
Paul , in 1 Corinthians 11 : 11 - 16 , endeavors to settle the matter about a woman ’ s wearing a head covering in the congregation , after which he says : “ If any man seems to dispute for some other custom , we have no other , neither do the congregations of God . ”
* Finally , what about head covering when you are part of a group but not personally voicing the prayer ?
I had the question popped into my head : What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like if you could connect the two spheres ?
Here &apos; s this guy who got a 34 - year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with , we as citizens are grappling with now . What do we take away ?
The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is -- when you &apos; ve talked about emergent behavior , when you &apos; ve talked about collective intelligence , the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask , who builds a neighborhood ?
So here &apos; s two questions that I have in my head when I think about this problem .
( PT ) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas , such as NOW , on new opportunities for women , HORIZON , for disabled persons , YOUTHSTART , for promoting the labour market integration of young people , and INTEGRA , for groups threatened with exclusion .
As a group , in order to demonstrate our willingness , we have broadened the usual horizons of the environment and we have added very clear support for the urban environment , which did not previously exist , we have increased interest in the countryside and the rural environment , we have also supported municipal participation , which did not feature in the proposal , and we have also supported public health with great enthusiasm .
Other factors which might affect development prospects for the European alcohol market at this time include the substantial levels of alcohol production in the applicant countries , future tariff reductions in the forthcoming WTO negotiations and a possible increase in bioethanol production for fuel in the European Union , that could significantly alter the horizon for traditional uses of European ethyl alcohol .
His work on this report is indeed remarkable and it opens up great horizons in many areas of research .
The plans will identify key actions in a limited number of priority fields and include a clear time horizon .
We have been successful on many occasions , including in recent years , for instance in CERN and the European Space Agency , with the ITER and Galileo projects , which have been a decisive step forward in strengthening Europe ’ s technological capabilities , and with the Erasmus project , which has opened up new European horizons to over a million young people .
Halfway through the planning horizon of the White Paper on transport , it transpires that the objectives are not yet within reach .
It is therefore an area of the utmost sensitivity and importance , which should merit special attention from the European Union , namely by means of this analysis conducted by the Dublin Agency , which may in some way help to anticipate the potential crises that we can all envisage on the horizon in any one of the 27 Member States .
By investing in robust partnerships in the area of technology and in the development of clean energy , agencies responsible for large volumes of emissions have chosen a path which is a lot more promising and which has opened up new horizons .
The transfer of all competencies relating to international trade from the level of the States to that of the Union is a further step in the establishment of a single industrial policy , with a view to a common economic policy and , on the horizon , further synergies between our States .
Most of the members point to the importance of the next framework on public health and the need we can see there to expand the horizons substantially beyond those of the current package of programmes .
So let us open up the field of culture to new horizons and new frontiers .
People are free to work ; job opportunities are created ; parents and children find their social horizons widened ; better parenting skills across the board enhance society as a whole .
Mr President , in Lisbon , a common horizon was set , establishing structural reforms for the modernisation of our economy , in order to increase growth and employment .
We need that oxygen , we need that horizon for the great European debate .
Quite the opposite - a realistic assessment suggests that there are only a few faint glimmers of hope on a dark horizon .
It is also a great pleasure to lay before such a forum , even in this brief address of mine , the internal problems of a country that , having gone through its own historic storm , has finally made out the coast of peace and freedom on the horizon .
Mr President , when a delegation from this Parliament was visiting the People &apos; s Republic of China some time ago , we were in Xiamen , in the south - east of China , and there was an island visible on the horizon .
We must therefore watch out for clouds on the horizon , and I am referring specifically to the fact that the Committee on Budgets today voted on its position on the financial regulation .
The internal market has given consumers the opportunity to expand their horizons enormously , and they no longer rely on what is on offer within the national market .
Finally , as we approach Laeken , first the king &apos; s mighty castle appears on the horizon .
The Ebner report - and I congratulate the rapporteur on the specific detail he has been able to put into it - takes this aspect further and opens up another horizon . I can state that he starts precisely from the conclusions of the previous report by indicating that the salvation of the mountains we are all calling for can start from the farming sector itself .
This &apos; triumvirate &apos; would not deserve any critical mention if there were not another triumvirate looming up on the horizon , a really heavy weight one this time , formed by the USA , Russia and the People &apos; s Republic of China .
And I say this because dark clouds are appearing on the horizon .
Looking at the horizon , though , I do not see that being feasible in the foreseeable future , and so I suggest that we go back to the test procedure we applied to cars and that has proved itself over time , thereby demonstrating a more realistic way of going about things than has previously been the case with motorcycles .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , my dear friends , I come from a land where the sun beats down and where the horizon is as wide as can be .
I am happy to see the efforts the Council and the Commission are making , but I am even happier to hear that there is a glimmer of light on the horizon .
Travel has opened up new horizons and new opportunities for human contact .
At these times , we must clear away doubts and help change a negative attitude , which is strongest in those countries which , right now , are blocking agreement in the chapter on agriculture and calling into question direct aids for agriculture , either through attempting to clear the financial horizon beyond 2006 or by questioning their inclusion in the Community acquis .
The media screen of achievements that you have put up does not hide the very serious questions appearing on the horizon .
It is true that some fundamental points on which agreement has been reached with regard to the principle of economic and social cohesion and to some of the relevant policies have ended up being reaffirmed - including the defence of the specific characteristics of the outermost regions - but the text does not ultimately have the vigour that I would like to see , especially in the context of the changes that are appearing on the horizon : enlargement and institutional reform .
The debate aroused by the Convention in recent months has already widened our horizons .
There are major tasks and important horizons involved in this process of European integration , but you have not presented them here .
I hope that we can still persuade the Commission not to be merely cautious in making common cause with us , but also to be our ally as regards new horizons in European integration .
According to a Chinese proverb , women carry half of heaven on their shoulders ; we are striving to open up the whole horizon as a means of shaping a Europe belonging to the regions &apos; citizens .
This is the crucial challenge , and this is why the Commission and I personally have called strongly for this matter to be taken up , as it must be , at the level of all the European countries , for if our young people are leaving Europe , if the situation is such that our businesses are setting up research laboratories outside Europe , particularly in the United States , I warn you that our horizons will become narrower and narrower , I warn you that , if we go on like this , all will be lost .
In fact , the well - known spreading across the European institutions of the single thought on the development of the European model weakens democratic debate , distances many citizens and narrows Europe &apos; s horizons .
Our horizons are widening , our borders are expanding and the arrival of new Member States will spur the Union on further to consolidate relations with its new neighbours , such that - as I see it - in the coming years , the Union &apos; s ability to provide its citizens with security , stability and sustainable development will depend on its desire and ability to step up and develop cooperation and dialogue with the new neighbouring countries .
Despite the many instances of reluctance to address mountain concerns , despite the fact that the mountains are not mentioned anywhere in this reform , we can say that there is hope on the horizon .
The regime bullies thousands of forced labourers , thousands of political detainees languish in the country &apos; s prisons , and the President , once democratically elected with an overwhelming majority , the holder of the Nobel Prize - and also the holder of the European Parliament &apos; s Sakharov Prize - was imprisoned for years and then , after a short period in which the hope of a thin silver lining of democracy could be seen on the horizon , was arrested again on 31 May this year together with nine other members of the country &apos; s parliament .
Today , wars are still being fought over oil , as in the Gulf , but violent conflicts are already emerging on the horizon over water .
It is becoming increasingly outrageous and intolerable that our competition policy , in a context that is quite different from that of the Treaties by which it was established in 1986 and 1992 , should remain bound by the impassable horizon of being simply a policy of the European Union .
Mr President , we can not explore new horizons if we do not know where we came from .
The street was totally vacant of people , and in the horizon I could see a mass of people .
Plumes of tear gas are seen rising in the horizon as the police shoot at protesters and passing cars .
As the sun rises and glints off the Aegean sea , the horizon is dotted with dinghies already en route , making slow progress through the turbulent waters .
Can you picture in your mind ’ s eye the ripe golden grain billowing in the wind as far as the horizon ?
Heat lightning occurs on the horizon and is considered to be the reflection of strokes too far away to be directly seen or heard .
At that height the horizon is 4.44 miles distant .
This is what happens when the sun dips below the horizon on the atmosphereless moon .
Thus darkness comes on gradually as the sun sinks farther below the horizon and illuminates less of the atmosphere above .
For example , in equatorial regions , at lower latitudes , the sun rises and sets almost vertically in relation to the horizon .
However , in temperate regions , at higher latitudes , the path of the sun is slanted in relation to the horizon .
Thus the sun takes longer to “ descend ” below the horizon to a point where it s rays do not reflect on the atmosphere above .
It begins at sunset and lasts until the sun has dropped six degrees below the horizon .
Next comes nautical twilight , which continues as the sun sinks to twelve degrees below the horizon .
At this point only general outlines of objects are discernible , the horizon appears indistinct and the brighter stars can be seen .
Finally astronomical twilight terminates when the sun reaches eighteen degrees below the horizon .
When the sun is about two degrees below the horizon , a gorgeous purple may appear .
The purple light lasts till the sun is about six degrees below the horizon .
And why does the sky sometimes turn deep orange or red near the horizon in the evening ?
But when the sun is near the horizon it can be different .

Bottom right depicts our universe , which on the horizon is not beyond that , but even that is just one bubble , as it were , in some vaster reality .
There &apos; s a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon .
&quot; If you have a waterfall in there , right out there at the horizon ; you look at the waterfall and you go , &quot; &quot; Oh , the water is falling really slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon .
These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls of islands beyond the visible horizon , simply by watching the reverberation of waves across the hull of their vessel , knowing full well that every island group in the Pacific has its unique refractive pattern that can be read with the same perspicacity with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint .
Machines are getting faster , it &apos; s getting less expensive , and there &apos; s some promising technological developments just on the horizon .
But it &apos; s never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low .
The horizon , the open road , is very , very glamorous .
What we &apos; ve done is we &apos; ve pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society .
In failing states , genocidal states , under - governed states , precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon , and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world &apos; s suffering tends to get concentrated .
The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers .
&#91; The Himalayas . &#93; The flat horizon that we &apos; ve evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite : unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste .
It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a limited condition .
The European 20 - 20 - 20 plan is an amazing breakthrough , something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon .

That bird sitting on the rhino ’ s back is an oxpecker , and it feeds upon the parasites found on the skin and in the ears of its host .
Infection is also a matter of ecology , that is , the condition of the host , your body .
The microbe is nothing , the terrain &#91; environment , ‘ host , ’ the body &#93; is everything . ”
An important characteristic of the plant is that it plays host to a special type of bacteria that has the ability to change free atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates .
They can exist only within a living cell as a host .
Today it is understood that many maladies — the communicable diseases — are the result of three factors : the agent , the environment , and the host .
When the agent is expelled from the reservoir — by coughing , sneezing or in some other way — it may be picked up and transported to a potential host , that is , someone who is susceptible to catching the disease .
If the agent finds the right way into the host , illness will result .
However , if it gets in through a deep cut in the skin , the host probably will become sick with the disease .
By this means they endeavor to control the environment so as to prevent the disease agent from getting to a new host .
“ Vector ” means “ carrier , ” and in the field of sanitation it denotes an animal or an insect that carries the disease agent to the new host .
When an infected person sneezes or coughs , he sprays the air with little droplets of water that are teeming with germs just waiting to get into a new host .
Since the microbes were at first “ harmless , ” did they actually become “ disease - producing , ” or was it the altered circumstances of their human hosts that made them harmful ?
No one likes a flea bite , but since most fleas do not live on their host , but just feed on him , the presence of a flea can be a good reminder to do a little more thorough housecleaning or to give your pet more careful attention .
A key point is this : To survive and prosper from generation to generation , this parasite requires two hosts , two living creatures inside which it can feed and develop .
Upon reaching such a host who has come into the water , the parasite bores through the skin and enters the bloodstream .
After mating , the female begins to release eggs into the bloodstream of the host , thus completing the cycle .
What are intestinal parasites , and how can you tell if you are playing host to these unwanted guests ?
Simply stated , a parasite is a living organism that obtains some benefit from its host , a living organism on or in which it lives .
Research confirmed her hypothesis by showing that the tube worm , as host , feeds the bacteria , and the bacteria feed the worm .
It can also result from the activity of luminous bacteria that enjoy a symbiotic relationship with their host .
In return , you , the host , provide the bacteria with food and a supportive environment .
When a bee alights on a flower , it enters into a symbiotic partnership with its host .
In exchange for nest sites and food , these insects might pollinate their host , disperse its seeds , help provide its nutrients , or protect it against herbivores , whether other insects or mammals .
As a caterpillar , it rewards its hosts with sugary excretions .
Instead of being a nuisance , the birds are actually doing their hosts a big favor by eating lice , ticks , and other parasites that the animals can not remove on their own .

The algas ’ main function , however , is to photosynthesize organic compounds , 98 percent of which they give to their host as “ rent . ”
The pig , it is believed , can be a host for viruses that infect such birds as chickens and ducks .
But it can also be the host for other viruses that infect humans .
“ Additionally , ” says the magazine , “ modern medical technologies such as transfusion and transplantation have provided viruses new means of transport between human hosts .
Clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually attenuates , and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity , and finds other hosts .
And , in principle , it could &apos; ve gone on forever , with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts .
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile .
As we spread our education and our technology , one of the things that we are doing is we &apos; re the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes -- the memes that they are prepared to die for .
So basically , viruses can &apos;t replicate themselves ; they need a host .
What they do , we now understand , is they get in you , they wait , they start growing , they count themselves with these little molecules , and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together , they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host .
Our nations are often pluri-secular , they have always attracted populations and ethnic groups different from their own , who have added their value to that of their hosts .
It remains very much to be seen whether this religious barbarism is really sufficient for us to form a closed international containment front against the hosts of Jihad conspirator , Osama bin Laden .
I believe that many Swedes were delighted to see their country finally being able to act as host to the leaders of the EU .
In this vein , the Italian hosts have invited leaders from South Africa , Nigeria , Mali , Algeria , Bangladesh and El Salvador to attend a working session and a dinner which should focus mainly on the poverty reduction strategy and the global health fund .
The People &apos; s Republic of China is free to make a new bid and it will be a worthy host of the Olympic Games if it puts the right conditions in place , by ending human rights violations and paving the way for democracy and the rule of law .

This is what we have been promised by George W. Bush and Kanan Makiya , a prominent figure amongst pro-American Iraqi exiles . According to the New York Times Magazine , this advisor to the President , who has lived in Cambridge since 1968 , apparently spent much of his meeting at the White House in January explaining to his distinguished host that there are two types of Muslims in Iraq : Shiites and Sunnis .
It will take place in Madrid on 23 - 24 October 2003 , and Spain has joined the group as host .
Our hosts were gracious and hospitable , we had useful discussions and we have a huge amount in common .
Meanwhile , it is important to note , in order to avoid any misunderstanding , that only the 266 host structures of the first two of these relays and networks – the IPEs and Carrefours – have ever received operating grants from the Commission since DG Press started overseeing them in 2001 .
In the majority of cases , the money given to the host structures has been supplemented by larger contributions provided from domestic resources .
First , at our meeting on 11 November 2003 , the Commission noted that we would have to take up the matter of host entities ’ grants again , with a view to taking a final decision in the light of the outcome of the budget trialogue of 13 November .
Sadly , that is exactly what happened this week : more than 80 parliamentarians and hundreds of candidates were disqualified by the Guardian Council , including the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee , Mr Mirdamadi , the main interlocutor and host of a European Parliament delegation which visited in Iran , who was here with a delegation last year .
At the same time it offers the possibility for each host to make greater investments in cultural facilities and in projects with long - term positive effects .
For instance , it should be possible to agree in the short term to a better definition of the role of the host of ministerial conferences .
We should also thank Germany for being a great host and providing a great team .
As it always does , the Commission has , this year , endeavoured to move our American hosts to involve the legislative bodies in the events on the margins of the summit ; as far as I am aware , the Americans &apos; current plan is to invite the TLD representatives to a briefing of senior officials from the European Union and the United States on the afternoon following the summit .
That shameless interference is all the more remarkable when we remember that next year China wants to play the gracious host of the Olympic Games .
The Commission can be justly proud of the confidence shown by the ITER partners in according Europe the central role of the host party to the joint implementation of this project .
We therefore support the initiative of our Indonesian hosts to invite finance ministers to a meeting on climate change and funding , to be held in Bali during the Conference .
Speaking about the Olympic Games , I think it is opportune to recall that seven years ago , in July 2001 , this Parliament concluded that China &apos; clearly fails to uphold universal human , civil and political rights &apos; and &apos; that this negative record and the repression in Tibet ... make it inappropriate &apos; for China to become the host of the 2008 Olympic Games .
We have reminded the Chinese time and again that it s role as an emerging power and host of the Olympic Games also entails responsibility .
I was not in favour of basing this joint project in Europe as the host pays a disproportionate part of the total budget .

Historian and host of History Needs You , Matthew Ward , called ISIS iconoclasts :
In a hilarious satirical jab , The Late O &apos; Clock News responded with a post that pitted Ian Alleyne , the controversial host of a local TV crime show famous for making morally questionable decisions , as a candidate to the discredited Integrity Commission :
There usually is much to be done after guests leave , and if it is late , it may work a hardship on the host .
But our host was well prepared to conduct our tour of this unusual mining operation safely .

You soon find your hosts are not ordinary people .
Nowadays the host may invite everyone into his courtyard .
Hosts who have some type of program in mind usually succeed in delighting and entertaining their invited friends in a beneficial way .
Some hosts feel that purchasing some ready - made game will help to keep their guests entertained .
An alert and discerning host quickly senses when a certain entertainment is starting to lose its interest - holding power .
If you ask your stubby , weather - beaten host where his ancestors originally came from , he will probably shake his head and tell you that it is all shrouded in mystery .
Confirming what the old chroniclers said , your host will tell you that his ancestors lived by hunting and fishing .
And what about the souls in hellfire , going there because they had received the Holy Communion without having fasted , or for having bitten or touched the host , or for not having attended Sunday Mass , or for having eaten meat on Friday ?
It certainly does not create a good impression when visitors clean their shoes with the towels or blankets belonging to their host .
It is disrespectful , too , to stay out later than the bedtime of one ’ s host , perhaps awakening him so as to be let in .
But if that should ever be your privilege , would it not be fine if your host felt as delighted to have had you as you were to have been there ?
For example , if you are at a gathering and the host has invited someone to do something to entertain his guests , then this is the time to watch and listen .
How we appreciated it when Carlos , our host , served us a refreshing pitcher of fruit juice .
The Japanese custom of bowing will fascinate you , but you will soon be doing the same quite unconsciously , and your hosts will note this with approval .
Your host teaches you to have your mouth very near the bowl ’ s edge , and while you scoop up a pile of noodles with the chopsticks he recommends that you suck hard .
The final laugh of the day comes as your hosts notice your long legs and big feet sticking out away past the bottom of the bedroll .
Your host may be in an expansive mood and offer you the run of the house , but it would be best for you to give more than the usual care to your surroundings .
Otherwise you might carelessly damage something that has not only monetary but also sentimental value , which may result in your own embarrassment and in the injury of your host .
And should you have a mishap , show your respect for the property of your host by having the moral courage to mention it and express your regrets .
Do not leave your host to discover it after you leave .
If the guests are foreign , the enjoyment of the host is doubled .
But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos; s the host of the show .
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host .
After I was invited by TED , I did some digging , because that &apos; s what we do , to know about my host .
&quot; Mike Rowe , the host of &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs , &quot; &quot; tells some compelling real - life job stories . Listen for his insights and observations about the nature of hard work , and how it ’ s been unjustifiably degraded in society today . &quot;
&quot; And my hosts in Pakistan said , &quot; &quot; Look , don &apos;t be too polite to us . &quot;
And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
And the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially that of a good host , anticipating the needs of the guest .
Host : And bless yourself . Thank you very much .
If the House agrees , I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested .
Mr President , like my colleague Mr Evans , it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom , the West Midlands , which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular .
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how , if we are not very careful , we can produce very grandiose - sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them .
&quot; If these changes to the report are supported by the House today , I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about , namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living , not by giving a hand - out but by giving a &quot; &quot; hand - up &quot; &quot; . &quot;
And let me assure you , furthermore , that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind , in line with the regulations , then the point of view of this House , as expressed in this report , will also be taken into account .
We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view . I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines , which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes .
We should also have the humility to recognise that , if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission , but also by a five - year programme , we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House , so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were .
When there are major set - piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future , we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance .
I am opposed to this , unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group , because I believe that , in competition policy terms , the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met , and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation .
So , Mr President , I will walk away from this debate , for which I am very grateful to Parliament , in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament &apos; s intellectual and political support , which appears to come from all sides of the House , for competition policy , its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future .
Two days later , as promised I get a call from the lost delivery guys trying to find my house in the war - zone that is my neighborhood .
Trung has mentioned having a government officer constantly parked outside of his house .
Walking around the neighborhood I detect the strong scent of “ hilu -mur ’ ( Sudanese juice ) and every house I enter people are hanging out their “ shermoot ” to dry ( meat that is later dried and grinded to add to food ) all these are tiny reminders that Ramadan is just around the corner .
It is a tendency to want to always keep Moroccans in Dar Ghefloun ( the house of ignorance ) as we say in Morocco .
Thursday we hung around the house mostly but decided to go out to Cinnabon in the evening to get a change in scenery .

May God help them and reward them for their losses in terms of houses and cars and souls .
Don ’ t be mistaken , but the term has a special meaning : it means getting married without a house , a car , a diamond ring and a proper wedding ceremony .
Among these ‘ naked ’ aspects , having no house is the key point .
They can observe that a husband supports his household financially and that he cares for maintenance of equipment in the house .
Also , has he worked with his father in caring for practical things around the house ?
On that day people receive the Money God into their houses with offerings of incense and sacrifices , hoping that this will bring them prosperity in the new year .
Then came a lunch stop at a small settlement — a few houses , one of which had been converted into a restaurant .
The Bible promise is : “ They will certainly build houses and have occupancy ; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage . ”
Then they were used on public buildings and the houses of the wealthy .
Since there is no word for bakery , one says “ haus bret , ” literally “ bread house . ”
Thus , rather than dwelling in igloo homes of snow , many live in low - cost prefabricated houses provided by the Canadian government .
She had come from a family that lived in a $ 50,000 house , and she had her own inheritance .
He made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in .
So for the cost of a house -- or around here , a garage -- you can put , you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress .
If you put up a video of your garage band , and it starts getting heavily accessed , you can lose your guitars or your house .
And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house .
And I got my daughter &apos; s Barbie doll dish , I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields , every day , in my house , and the ants were attracted to the mycelium , because there &apos; s no spores .
So , the house is no longer suitable for invasion .
And so my house came down , I received my first patent against carpenter ants , termites and fire ants .
My dad was always whistling around the house , and I just thought that &apos; s part of communication in my family .
It &apos; s what &apos; s known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm , and just like the alarm on your car or your house , it &apos; s meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder , thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away .
The color represents different rooms they are in the house .
But when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time -- and we &apos; re looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house , to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up , about gait and stride length -- these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we &apos; ve never understood before .
&quot; After referring to the black Africans as &quot; &quot; beasts who have no houses , &quot; &quot; he writes , &quot; &quot; They are also people without heads , having their mouth and eyes in their breasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
And they were looking at the Netflix queues , and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed , which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses .
Man : I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house -- I do it that way .
It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions .
I thought if I had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life , then I could be happy .
That &apos; s why we all live in developer houses .
This led to a full - scale investigation , and I was removed from the house for three days , until they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises .
And he got , from other data sources , information to show which houses are occupied by white people .
&quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Well , now , I need a house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium - sized businesses , and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas , of legitimising the nature of the internal market .
We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council , particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year , so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution , and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House .
That of external trade , where I believe the European Union should uphold progress towards a liberalised world - trade order ; that of industry , European industry , where jobs and industries are at threat from sanctions and they are innocent victims of these sanctions ; and I speak from the perspective of a UK Member of this House who is tired of receiving letters of complaint from companies whose business and whose workers &apos; jobs are at threat from the sanctions through no fault of their own .
It is important to SMEs , it is important to the public sector , it is probably a far more important instrument for promoting employment than many of the resolutions passed here in this House .
Mr President , as far as the Middle East and the Israeli - Palestinian peace process is concerned , I have always counted myself among those in the House who say that it is up to the people of the region and their leaders to define the terms of their peaceful coexistence , just as it is up to them to make the efforts and sacrifices needed on both sides in order to do so .
Secondly , to the Commissioner , I know you will not today be able to accept my Amendment No 56 on procurement , but in your reply I ask you to promise this House that you will bring forward new legislation to link the power of the public purse to companies &apos; compliance with these laws .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , after eleven years in this House , I can bear witness to the fact that debates on small and medium - sized businesses in our Parliament are neither new nor rare .
Are you aware that this afternoon Mr Fischler said to us in this House that it is not necessary to sacrifice all the animals on a farm where only one case has been declared ?
As a result of this House &apos; s decision to reject the directive , the European capital markets will continue to be fragmented in a key area , namely the trading of companies .
I support this initiative , although it will still have to be voted upon in the House , when I will learn to what extent Mr Fatuzzo &apos; s explanations of vote are appreciated . With regard to Mr Menrad &apos; s report , Mr Fatuzzo voted for the motion for he considers that it is right for workers to be informed about what will happen to them when their company closes .
We have to recognise that , unlike external lawyers , in - house lawyers are employees of the company and take their orders from it .
Your support is absolutely essential and , in any event , we will keep this House fully informed of all the steps we take in relation to this project .
When you see the behaviour of the directors of many companies , especially the multinationals , who decide to restructure , relocate or even partially or totally close down their businesses , making hundreds or thousands of workers unemployed simply to cut costs and / or increase profits , it is all the more intolerable that the Council should not have accepted proposals that we have adopted in this House .
I will now also expressly welcome and support the encouragement you have given in this House to the Czech Government and the Czech public to do everything possible to put a stop to such discriminatory effects in the legal field as may still result from these Bene ? Decrees , and thus remove potential obstacles on the path to enlargement .
At the same time , traditional schools are becoming a clearing house for lifelong learning by &apos; opening up their facilities &apos; to &apos; local communities and enterprises &apos; , that is , multinationals will have a say about school curricula ; this is already happening with pilot programmes being funded in Greece by the ? U.
I believe that the United States , the subject of much criticism in this House , is right on this point , and I feel that Europe must do more in the area of agricultural policy , agricultural protectionism and other forms of trade protectionism .
Penalising German businesses for Spanish omissions is the wrong way to go about things , and so I ask the House to support item 75 , which is intended to give more responsibility to the Member States .
The foundations of cultural sites are giving way under the attacks from Israeli tanks and helicopters , which are also battering public and professional buildings , schools , houses and refugee camps , causing thousands of civilian casualties .
As regards &apos; in - house &apos; contracts , there are conflicting points of view : the representatives of producers &apos; associations are decidedly against reserving contracts for an enterprise of which the contracting entity is part , even if it has independent legal personality , without a competition , and your rapporteur agrees with them .
In its present form the directive could significantly harm independent software developers and European small - and medium - sized software houses , which may find it impossible to survive in the &apos; patents jungle &apos; of the great software giants .
If you had been present in the House when we discussed a very important &apos; national &apos; issue - the notorious situation of a French company - you would have understood that the Commission does not deal with such matters .
The Commission has been put under pressure by campaigns from businesses and from elements in this House .
When I say that there is the danger of us sustaining more setbacks in this area , I am not just referring yet again to the new Member States , but also to the present ones , which have to make enormous efforts to get that sort of quota into this House .
I am certainly pleased to do that on behalf of the House , Mr Alyssandrakis .
As Mr Sjöstedt said in this House , it is of course entirely true that the repeated signing of contracts with companies that have behaved quite unacceptably is inadmissible and that the Commission should simply have avoided having anything to do with such companies .
It is not for this House to warn only one side against taking unilateral and perilous courses of action ; rather , it should also urge the other side to be sensible and hold back , to endeavour to leave the way open to peaceful agreement .
So I would urge us in this House to keep on track in campaigning for the 3 % expenditure on research and for the launching of an innovation strategy for small - and medium - sized enterprises .
For us in this House , however , it is especially important to find out how the introduction of Basel II will impact on our small - and medium - sized businesses in particular and which tasks still have to be addressed by the finance ministers and others in order to ensure the successful introduction of Basel II .
For that reason , we are convinced that we in this House must , from now on , make the effort to take up a position and also accept our responsibilities .
– I should like , at this point , to bring to the attention of the Members of this House and to your attention , Mr President , the reality of relocations by multinationals .
The fact is that a central bank also has the task of sounding the alarm when ever - increasing concentration of ownership gives the private banking sector more power over the market and when cuts in key interest rates serve primarily to increase the finance houses ’ profit margins , instead of being felt by smaller enterprises and consumers .
– Mr President , I wish to inform the House that a project has been approved and is being implemented in Thessaloniki , with European Union funding , for the construction and equipping of a sports and cultural centre with enhanced accessibility for disabled persons , by the non-trading , non-profit-making company Adapted Physical Activity Cultural Development Centre 2000 , with the participation of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and the municipality of Thermaiko .
The matter is currently before the French courts , but I am sure that this House will join me in asking the President of this Parliament to write to Eutelsat demanding a full explanation of why it is breaking its own charter committed to upholding media freedom .
It has not yet been possible to verify whether this is the case , and the conclusion I would draw from this is that no further amendments should be tabled before this House for the foreseeable future , or until the issue of whether our endeavours in this field serve any real purpose has been settled .
The additional EUR 7 million proposed by Mrs Thomsen and approved by the House today will therefore mobilise many times this sum in investment capital for existing small and mediumsized enterprises and business startups .
This is a social problem , but it is also an economic one in terms of our ability to bring about prosperity because , as was said in this House earlier , it is not growth that creates jobs .
It is making every effort to encourage the Member States to take all of the measures required for an appropriate level of preparedness in the event of a bioterrorist attack , and hopes to be able to rely on the full support of this House in persuading all of the Member States to act more incisively , by investing greater resources , because the threat of a bioterrorist attack can not and must not find us unprepared .
Having visited the workers during the summer recess , I would like to draw the attention of the House to the poor industrial relations records of some of these companies and the need for an amicable settlement .
Another example , and one on which there was a great deal of consensus in this House , was the disclosure of ratings , which is of particular importance to small and medium - sized businesses , and I am grateful to the Council for eventually accepting Parliament ’ s proposed compromise on this .
I would ask you to endorse this proposal and report in order that this House may send a clear message to the effect that we believe that accounting scandals within companies in Europe must stop .
While the goal – an ambitious one , and important in terms of environmental policy – of changing air - conditioning units over to non-fluorinated gases by 2011 is to be welcomed , it has to be said that it does create problems for small and medium - sized enterprises , and that is why , at first reading , this House adopted a derogation , according to which , if the number of units produced is less than 50 000 per annum , the new arrangements can be introduced two years later – that is , in 2013 .
While we support the Vice - President in what she plans to do , better regulation is also a task for us in this House .
It is a curious fact that all those Members of the House who have claimed to be acting out of concern for small and medium - sized enterprises have tabled amendments that would make matters worse for these latter .
Let me once again appeal to the House to support Slovakia in this instance and give it a real helping hand , so that we can , in the interests of Europe ’ s safety , close this power station down as soon as possible .
That was our experience at the time of the steel dispute , when all at once our telephones in this House started jumping off the hook , with businesses and trade unions phoning up to tell us that hundreds and thousands of people were having to be laid off because 100 % mark - ups for customs duties were making exports impossible .
Mr President , I would like to bring to the attention of the House a report this week that three of the world ’ s largest oil companies no longer directly own petrol filling stations in Northern Ireland .
What I expect of the Commission is that it should reconsider this five - year period , which , with this amount of subsidy , distorts competition ; that it should incorporate the period of five years as recommended by this House into its regulation on subsidies , and , moreover , that it should monitor more closely those companies that engage in this sort of subsidy hopping and blacklist them in the way the rapporteur has suggested .
All political groups in this House are divided about what we should do .
One of these was Amendment 250 , which was intended to set up a pilot project for small and medium - sized enterprises in developing countries , which were , I would remind the House , the subject of a report we adopted earlier this year .
That , by the same token , makes cooperation between municipalities possible in principle , albeit subject to the restrictions that are so well stated in what is now paragraph 45 of the Weiler report , namely when cooperation between municipalities is for the purpose of administrative restructuring or where real in - house monitoring is provided for .
For these reasons and also so as not to have to start from scratch with the new public contract rules , which are scarcely at the transposition stage in the Member States , we think it appropriate to legislate on mixed public - private companies and on the &apos; in - house &apos; concept .
Unfortunately , as has been said in this House , it seems that the Iranian authorities are less willing than they have been in the past to take our requests into serious consideration or to make any tangible efforts to improve the situation .
We have improved the information with which consumers are provided , while your House was , at the same time , aware of the need for consideration to be given to the concerns and interests of those on the other side , namely the hundreds and thousands of small and medium - sized businesses that will be obliged to apply REACH .
When I last spoke in this House , I said we would have succeeded the day we adopted a system that was balanced , simple , effective and that enterprises could use .
This House expects to be involved - as is only right and proper - for that is the only way in which we can help to communicate the Lisbon goals to the public , to businesses , to trade unions and to workers .
We did indeed accept the great majority of your House &apos; s amendments , particularly as regards small and medium - sized enterprises , in the form , for example , of reductions in charges and derogations from central licensing ; all that is in there .
This House has once again managed to miss out on an opportunity to give due account to a specific reality , namely that small and medium - sized enterprises occupy a critical position in our economy and in Europe .
I would like to see this greater awareness of the impacts on micro-enterprises being carried over into other areas of legislation that we discuss in this House as well , especially environmental and consumer protection .
We in this House have to be very careful that we encourage individuals to start up new businesses and do not encourage jobs to move continents because we are regulating jobs out of existence .
I recently visited the Jaguar Land Rover plant in my constituency , where I saw how the company has turned itself into a world leader in green automobile technology , and where the new type - approval guidelines we have been adopting in this House have been welcomed wholeheartedly .
The company director was told that if he took out a mortgage on his own dwelling house , then they would allow him .
I am also pleased that the report conveys concern to the Council and the Commission regarding the real risk posed by businesses that are both content providers and advertising sales houses .
Barely three months ago , this House adopted a report on implementation of the Services Directive , in which we draw attention principally to the fact that the one - stop shops are not fully operational , that in most cases , they do not allow completion of formalities by electronic means and that they are not working in the way which businesses expect .
Madam Commissioner , in congratulating you today and in asking the House to approve this fisheries agreement , we can not overlook the fact that we must make a very serious effort to adapt our fleet to the fishing opportunities .
The resolution goes into much more detail , which we do not have time to deal with in our short speaking - time , but I commend it fully to the House .
In this framework of analysis and debate , it has fallen upon the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to present to the House a set - an important set in my opinion - of reports dealing with competition policy , the single market , controls over company concentration operations , industrial restructuring and relocation , as well as the development of small and medium - sized undertakings .
I have to advise the House that the Commission has no legal power to intervene on this specific issue since there is no general Community law which covers the right to compensation for individuals or companies which have been affected by strike action , nor is it likely that there ever will be such law at Community level .
I would point out to the House that if the Member States do not achieve convergence and , as Mr van Velzen has already said , they have to make great efforts to catch up on various issues like EMU and the stability pact , we could well find ourselves in a situation where industrial unrest makes our Europe look a great deal less solid than it does now .
So although I intend to vote in favour of it , I can not help feeling that , in view of Beijing &apos; s obvious unwillingness to listen , we in the House should be able to come up with some other measures which might actually have an effect on Communist China .
Concerning the report of Mrs Torres Marques , I can assure the House that we intend to respond to the call for the introduction of measures in favour of the craft industry and small enterprises .
I can also inform the House that work has been completed on a report on the SME capital market .
I hope that the Commission and other responsible bodies in Europe will undertake something on the basis of this present resolution and that we in this House will continue to follow developments concerning children in central and eastern Europe .
The House should be able to agree on a number of demands : we need to channel public funds more directly into productive investment ; private companies must be more strongly reminded of their duty in terms of promoting the economy and jobs ; and we need better coordination of economic policies and stronger links between the policies of the Member States and the Community .
They should , for example in the area of tax , promote investment in human resources and the development of in - house training .
Using that cement , the company puts up a large government building , then a factory , later an apartment house , a school , finally a bridge .
Practically all barbiturates are produced by legitimate pharmaceutical houses , but a large part of the supply is diverted into illegal channels .
Many companies have developed in - house procedures for dealing with workplace molestation .
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle , for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century .
It would be self - indulgent and self - defeating , as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity , to want anything else .
To fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow , not just for our fishermen and the people of Europe but , more seriously , for humanity as a whole .
It seems to us highly appropriate to speak in the European Parliament of regulations which have enriched humanity &apos; s legal heritage and we should take every opportunity to recall and strengthen the validity of those instruments given the protection they offer and the rights they safeguard .
The various charters and declarations which mark the history , firstly , of European / American politics , and then , later , world politics , are milestones which have ennobled the collective life of humanity , carrying it aloft on the shoulders of Christian values and the Enlightenment through to today &apos; s democratic ideals .
It is not a question of restricting that freedom but , on the contrary , of becoming aware that man lives within a family and national community , that his humanity imposes rules on him , failing which civilisation becomes synonymous with barbarism .
It is just as clear to my group and to myself that the genetic inheritance of humanity must remain common property and should not be sold off on the floor of the stock exchange .
In rising up against the death penalty we also rise up against all that barbarity , against the barbarity linked to permanently organising society so that all the wealth is concentrated in the hands of a minority and the great mass of humanity is condemned to poverty .
Mr President , Commissioner , twenty years have passed since the philosopher and essayist , Alvin Toffler , identified the new information technologies as the third of humanity &apos; s great revolutions .
- ( IT ) I abstained from the vote on the joint resolution on poor countries &apos; debt because I feel that it is wishy - washy and ambiguous in the face of the financial mechanisms known to us all which plunge the greater part of humanity into the most abject poverty .
The fight against racism is clearly based precisely on the rejection of the concept of race , on its denunciation and on the refusal to place men and women in this category and to divide humanity according to this concept .
This new form of slavery mainly affects women and girls but , irrespective of who is being enslaved , the mere presence of slavery is humanity &apos; s best evidence of poverty .
Mr President , Commissioner , we know that this question , in connection with which the third and final reading is about to take place , is a major problem for humanity .
Obviously , a vote in Parliament will not bring about this upheaval , although it is an essential need for humanity .
That commitment is all the more necessary because it would not be just immoral and dangerous for development and the progress of humanity , it would threaten world peace and equilibrium if recent advances , especially in treatment , were just to benefit the richest countries .
To conclude , I believe that the knowledge that has been acquired in gene therapy could be promising for humanity , but that they are also full of potential risks and are open to serious abuse .
Is humanity regressing towards the decadence of ancient Rome ? Is competitive sport once again becoming a gladiatorial conflict , waged now by robotic humans armed with the latest bio - and cybertechnology and funded by politico - financial interests ?
In the case of cloning research , I wonder whether , in actual fact , a decision has already been made to do something to harm humanity rather than waiting for unbiased research to generate scientific results and only then deciding how to use them .
Civilisation and humanity show their character most clearly in the way in which they treat life when it is defenceless .
The tropical forests and their various functions and usefulness to humanity can contribute to a large extent to the achievement of the Union &apos; s aims , not only in terms of development and the environment , but also with regard to its objectives of fighting poverty and sustainable economic and social development .
The United Nations Millennium Summit closed with the identification of the great world - wide issues in which the international community is called to intervene in the interests of the whole of humanity : freedom , equality , solidarity , tolerance , respect for nature and sharing of responsibility .
Nature has determined that woman should carry the future of humanity in her womb .
To the left of us , we have Karl Marx , the revolutionary thinker , who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of human rights , because , in his view , the human does not exist in the abstract , and humanity could not constitute anything at all .
Moreover , I hope that this capacity to exert pressure and the speed with which the Union tackled the issue of anti-personnel landmines might serve as an example for the ratification of other agreements which have always been extremely important to Parliament , such as the establishment of the International Tribunal for Crimes Against Humanity , not to mention the moratorium on the use of the death penalty .
Therefore , what we want from Parliament , the Commission and the Council too is sound pragmatism : we must endeavour to understand how we can be effective , how we can tip the balance so that the death penalty ceases to disgrace the whole of humanity .
I call on all of those who can , especially youth , in Iraq and elsewhere , to do everything possible to protect this heritage , to claim it as their own , and as the heritage of the whole of humanity .
Whether you support LGBT rights or you do not , the one thing that we must all agree on is that there can never be any justification for murder , and that those who are guilty of such savage slaughter are enemies of the state and of everything that is decent in humanity .
Things that might have triggered memories in you too , because in all the intersections that make up our humanity , there might lurk a story of being “ othered . ”
A noted scientist comments in Reader ’ s Digest , February 1969 : “ It is shockingly apparent that , in the battle to feed humanity , our side has been routed .... it is already too late to prevent a drastic rise in the death rate through starvation .
They died to teach vandal nations that nevermore will humanity permit the exploitation of peoples for militaristic purposes ... &#91; this resulted in &#93; the spread of enlightened liberty and the destruction of autocracy . ”
Looking at the present sorry state of humanity , some are constrained to ask : Is the problem beyond God ’ s wisdom , as it has proved to be with man ?
Paul Ehrlich says : “ The battle to feed all of humanity is over .
“ If the soldier is convinced that with the cause for which he is fighting is involved the welfare of humanity as a whole , including , therefore , in the long run that of Germany also , he can not only shoot the German in the trenches opposite without any feeling of personal dislike , but he can do so for the love of man ....
Although men disagree on how this change should come about , God ’ s infallible Word , the Bible , tells us how it will most certainly occur , not only for Uruguay , but for all humanity .
A grand new system for the blessing of humanity ?
May my Christian brothers permit me the confidence and courage to admit that among the most responsible in the face of humanity , we find ourselves . ”
Humanity has experimented with government for thousands of years .
Who could be trusted to decide what should be sacrificed for the good of humanity ?
It can not solve humanity ’ s problems ; neither can it solve personal problems .
For example , a British documentary , “ The Fight Against Slavery , ” showed , as reported in one magazine , “ that slavery was a crime not merely against blacks but all humanity .
In it , among other things , they acknowledge the major problems facing humanity and the growing climate of mistrust , fear and insecurity .
There &apos; s a tight and surprising link between the ocean &apos; s health and ours , says marine biologist Stephen Palumbi . He shows how toxins at the bottom of the ocean food chain find their way into our bodies , with a shocking story of toxic contamination from a Japanese fish market . His work points a way forward for saving the oceans &apos; health -- and humanity &apos; s .
And I was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has .
That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible , but it &apos; s something that really accompanied humanity .
I believe that to confront such a crisis , only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity , to mankind &apos; s deepest aspirations , and to the historic demands of our times .
Bush meat is one of the central crises , which is occurring in our population right now , in humanity , on this planet .
As has been said before , we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in . Some of us just go one god further .
One -sixth of humanity is there . It &apos; s soon going to be more than that .
And I would suggest , it is not only humanity that won &apos;t survive , but it is all species on the planet , as we &apos; ve heard today .
And here begins 400 years of frustration , of unfulfilled dreams -- the dreams of Galileo , Giordano Bruno , many others -- which never led to the answer of those very basic questions which humanity has asked all the time .
Nothing like this existed in China , where there was one monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity , and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination , which took three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters and very complex Confucian essay writing .
Technologist and futurist Bill Joy talks about several big worries for humanity -- and several big hopes in the fields of health , education and future tech .
Clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually attenuates , and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity , and finds other hosts .
From about the beginnings of humanity to 1500 : zero economic growth , nothing .
Throughout humankind &apos; s history , we &apos; ve driven species after species extinct : the passenger pigeon , the Eastern cougar , the dodo ... But now , says Stewart Brand , we have the technology to bring back species that humanity wiped out . So -- should we ? Which ones ? He asks a big question whose answer is closer than you may think .
If we were to wipe out insects alone , just that group alone , on this planet -- which we are trying hard to do -- the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land .
As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals , birds , frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity ?
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity .
Can the interests of an individual nation be reconciled with humanity &apos; s greater good ? Can a patriotic , nationally elected politician really give people in other countries equal consideration ? Following his TEDTalk calling for a global ethic , UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown fields questions from TED Curator Chris Anderson .
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .
The only phase , as we know it that can support humanity .
In my mind , the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation .
And could we even define a planetary boundary , a fence , within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity ?
And today , we are in a situation where we estimate that we &apos; ve transgressed three boundaries , the rate of biodiversity loss , which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity -- one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs -- nitrogen and climate change .
So by the year 2040 , the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity , in raw bits and stuff . And this is , I think , where Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we &apos; re going to cross .
All of humanity , probably , is descended from a thousand people who left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago .
These myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being new , failed attempts at being modern .
The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us .
And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth , taking with it not only plants and animals , but the legacy of humanity &apos; s brilliance .
So , you &apos; re living through a time when virtually half of humanity &apos; s intellectual , social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away .
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity .
Secondly , there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile , led by Ricardo Núñez , whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice , and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system , which is independent , is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet , concerning his crimes against humanity .
Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons , particularly Flora Brovina , a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met , together with the Women in Black of Belgrade , during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups .
The one sure way to achieve this is to send a clear message to those who are guilty of crimes against humanity that they will be brought to justice for their evil deeds .
The groundbreaking ruling by the House of Lords illustrates one way in which concerned countries can demonstrate to those that commit crimes against humanity that there will be no hiding place for them .
Mr President , whichever way we view the Balkans , in the light of recent atrocities or future events in terms of the Stability Pact , we always seem to come up against this horrifying character of Milosevic and his cronies , people who have a string of crimes against humanity to answer for and who should urgently be taken to the Court of Justice in The Hague .
The European Union will need to look for powers in Serbia which are not driven by this blinkered nationalism but by values whose observance has also proved to benefit humanity in the European Union .
Acknowledging that slavery was a crime against humanity would be an important gesture .
That unanimity is reassuring , because all the signatories to this resolution are in agreement on the essential point . That has happened because we all now know that the essential point is a certain concept of humanity , relations between peoples , values - in short , civilisation , the heart of Europe &apos; s identity .
Only clear and decisive action by the international community as a whole can put an end to it : the arms embargo ; the control of diamond trafficking ; the deployment of a rapid intervention force , under the mandate of the United Nations ; and the prosecution of the perpetrators of crimes against humanity , the savage attacks against civilians , against international peace and security as well as against the United Nations forces .
Let us have a peace for all Sri Lankans , based on citizens &apos; rights , humanity and in which government resources are directed at building communities , not helping to destroy them .
The Statute is the first international accord to stipulate that rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy may be treated as crimes against humanity and war crimes .
It is , however , extremely important , because the treaty from the Rome Conference is the first international agreement that establishes that rape and forced pregnancy can be treated as war crimes and crimes against humanity .
First of all I wholly endorse what the honourable Member has said about the importance of the statute &apos; s inclusion of crimes of sexual violence as crimes against humanity when , as has been the case , they are committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population .
Many of us - and I do not know all of you , but I know some of you - have deeply - felt value systems which are at least as deep as our commitment to law and understanding and humanity .
This is a bloodbath and a crime against humanity .
However , those who , as a matter of course , only ever lay responsibility for crimes against humanity at the door of their political opponents , are committing the fatal error of simply using those very crimes to absolve themselves of all blame .
The first aspect is that the European Union should deny asylum - and not negotiate with other countries either - to a figure such as Montesinos , who is responsible for terrible crimes against humanity . The second is that a delegation should be sent from the European Parliament to Peru with the purpose of assessing the prospects for democratic progress and for peacefully overcoming the present problems , so that our contribution will be a very positive one .
This point is very important because this tribunal also wants to act as a pioneer and to be the first to raise the question of the crimes against humanity committed against women .
I hope , Mrs Theorin , that we will take an initiative on behalf of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities to support this action with a view to recognising and making reparations for this crime against humanity perpetrated against women .
I am pleased that the UN issued indictments today because of crimes against humanity in East Timor , and Indonesia should be aware , with or without cooperation , that those trials will go ahead .
Wen Jiabao and Hu Jintao are both responsible for crimes against Humanity in China and Tibet ( if you believe is not part of China ) .
Since no country wants to take them in , we feel sympathy for those people on the ground of humanity and refugee .

“ His versatility , eagerness , activity , and humanity ; the immense range of his curiosity , in all things physical , moral , or social ; his place in science , in theology , in philosophy , and in politics ; his peculiar relation to the &#91; French &#93; Revolution , and the pathetic story of his unmerited sufferings , may make him the hero of the eighteenth century . ” — Frederic Harrison , philosopher .

And if you could feel the warmth , and feel the humanity , and feel his intent coming through the eyes , then we would succeed .
So to invoke another metaphor , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity -- I &apos; m connected to you and you to her , on out endlessly into the distance -- this fabric is actually like an old - fashioned American quilt , and it has patches on it : happy and unhappy patches .
In fact , our humanity , and everything that we think about ourselves is something that we &apos; ve invented .

Therefore as India and Pakistan , as you and I , it behooves us to transcend our differences , to celebrate our diversity , to leverage our common humanity .
This does express the humanity of what &apos; s going on , and the personal relationships , but that is also like saying that it &apos; s the same thing as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting .

It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer .
&quot; I &apos; ve always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off , who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic -- people like Martin Luther King , Jr . , who wrote , &quot; &quot; I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be . &quot;
And what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting - edge technology -- robotics , bionics -- with the age - old poetry , we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity .
I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity , we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have .
It is our humanity , and all the potential within it , that makes us beautiful .
I &apos; m more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves -- how as a writer , I find that African writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent .
Mr Solana , you yourself are a perfect illustration of this , as it were , structural complicity , passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same . Of course , in reality , they are the same thing .
I see this as a clear illustration of the current questions in Baia Mare and of the investigation which is under way there concerning who is really liable .
I have seen the fishing boats tossing in the harbour , a picture which spoke volumes , vividly illustrating the enforced inactivity of the fishermen . Or was it , or is it , an illustration of our own incapability ?

Contrary to what the Commission has suggested , Articles 30 , 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty are not applicable , as the Commission would be interfering with the safety of nuclear installations in respect of their technical operation .
The design also ensures that , with the exception of some specialist technical installations , the Berlaymo nt will be fully accessible to people with mobility difficulties .
On the one hand , the public could genuinely participate when it is vitally important to check the operating permits of installations and factories , such as when there is a danger of an increase in the amount of environmental harm being done .
Sixthly , an opt -in clause is included , permitting Member States to extend the system to other installations and activities .
Major problems result from this latter not being done , and from these installations being used infrequently .
We managed to make a final declaration calling for the installation of a parliamentary pillar in the WTO .
It has persisted in the military occupation , in destroying infrastructure , housing and other installations , in carrying out targeted killings , and in holding more than 7 000 Palestinian prisoners , almost 340 of whom are children , in Israeli jails .
I would also like to point out that the Commission has asked the German Government to ensure that the installation of tolls hinders the free movement of traffic in Europe as little as possible and that , if problems arise once it is in operation , the Commission would take the appropriate measures .
There is also the not insubstantial cost to business and individuals , who presumably would have to pay for the installation of such technology .
These objectives are taken up in the trans - European Energy – TEN - E – guidelines aiming at the installation of an electricity and gas network of truly European character by better linking the fragmented national networks .
Alternatives to a wide range of products and installations are available , and are capable of bringing about a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions ; some of them even reduce energy consumption at the same time .
This advice tells us that it is extremely difficult to measure eel escapement and that it is preferable to focus on directly applicable measures such as a 50 % reduction in the impact on eels due to fishing and a similar reduction in the effect on eels of fixed installations such as turbines and pumps .
It is now clear that the human and financial resources allocated for the implementation of SIS II will have to be shared between three projects being developed simultaneously : SIS II , SISone4 all and the installation , operation and management of a communication infrastructure .
As a result , all investments in the development of new energy technologies , firstly to reduce environmental impact and enhance the safety of existing installations and secondly to develop new energy sources and ensure more efficient and cleaner use of fossil fuels , are of particular importance .
The limitless expansion strategy of NATO , the bombing of Serbia , the recognition of the unilaterally proclaimed independence of Kosovo , the support for the installation of the anti-missile defence shield on European soil , not to mention the extreme glorification of the region &apos; s leaders who should , perhaps , be more cautious when making anti-Russian and pro-Western statements , all these choices are evidence of a short - sighted policy worthy of the current White House , but not worthy of a European security policy .
To that end , the adoption of the Convention represents a step forward in establishing dignified working conditions for professionals in this important strategic sector , in that it covers a variety of aspects of professional activity , namely improved installations and safety conditions at work , pay , medical care at sea and on land , rest periods , work contracts and social security .
The fourth task for the future concerns the installation , the creation , the establishment of a deposit guarantee mechanism , as we have today in banking , and which is still lacking in the insurance sector .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to come back to the subject of the installation of body scanners in airports .
The resolution acquits NATO of the war and the dismemberment of Serbia and supports the long - term presence of NATO troops and bases in Kosovo and the area as a whole and Euro - unifying interventions through the installation of their forces via EULEX .
That is why I think it is essential for us to do as the US had no hesitation in doing , and introduce a moratorium on new installations so that the conditions mentioned just now can be fulfilled .
We want to ensure that steps are also undertaken to decommission installations that are still operational and which may need to be decommissioned shortly .
The UN &apos; s Darusman report , which is the immediate pretext for this debate , states clearly that in those final stages , the LTTE used the civilian population as human shields , intensified the forcible recruitment of civilians , including children , into it s ranks , executed civilians who attempted to escape the conflict zone and deployed artillery in proximity to displaced civilians and civilian installations such as hospitals .
The current directive only covers spent fuel storage facilities directly related to nuclear installations , the current proposal intends to assure safety in the long term of the management of existing and future radioactive waste .
I hope that the waste- return programme currently under examination , whereby feed residues from feed mixers and similar installations are taken back and disposed of , will provide additional safety .
Secondly , we are concerned that certain installations are excluded from the directive , particularly military establishments , land - fill sites and certain intermediate storage areas such as those in rail depots , docks and other places .
It is also essential that there is proper public participation and that the public is informed and given full information about the planning and licensing procedures for these sites and for new installations in particular .
There are a number of other technical issues with regard to harmonization of certain reporting criteria and harmonization of certain aspects of the inspection of these installations .
I shall not go through them all , particularly on such a hot afternoon , but I would like to mention nuclear and military installations and storage facilities .
As a result , such installations are exempted from having to submit a danger study and a major accident emergency plan , even though they are not covered by any other Community directive .
Given that serious damage has been caused to all basic infrastructures in the regions affected , to homes , businesses , agricultural crops and installations , it and is therefore essential that urgent measures be implemented firstly to rehabilitate the areas affected and secondly , perhaps more importantly , to set up a budget line , as already stated , to prevent and repair the damage caused by the downpours which come , year after year , to devastate this area .
Finally , there were exclusions for undertakings manufacturing lubricants , and installations for the production of hydrocarbons at sea were not taken into account either .
We also know , as Mr Santini mentioned just now , that on 12 November there was a meeting between Federal and Länder vets and the Italian authorities , and on that occasion the installations were visited , found to be in optimum conditions and there was even a draft protocol in which the Italians asked for special guarantees , strict guarantees of the quality of the animals when they leave the country of origin .
It must also be said in this context that both the Commission &apos; s text and Parliament &apos; s improvements to it place particular emphasis on the need for quality control in the hospitals and installations concerned , and for the staff to have appropriate training .
We must convince them that if we identify the aspects that can be run at European level , that would add value to the sector and ease the management of the SMEs to coordinate the relationship between tourism and the environment , stimulate the modernization of installations , conservation of the artistic heritage , rural tourism , reassess training , assist the search for new products that keep the industry in momentum and create permanent jobs , setting quality products and services as the main priority .
There are no permanent military installations at the airport .
They are not being smuggled because they are themselves so valuable , but because their manufacture is prohibited , and yet much equipment and many installations that can not function without CFCs are still in existence .
One must also work towards the phased removal , modification or replacement with new models of all those installations that still operate with CFCs today .
The Council also considers that optimal use should be made of installations at the national level , and that there should be more detailed examination of the various approaches possible which might , among other things , reduce transportation of radioactive waste .
The challenge is to reduce emissions by 67 % as compared with their 1990 levels , by requiring conformity of installations before the year 2007 .
Third , is there any truth in the statements from some colleagues that countries in Central Europe are prepared to cooperate with the installation of 1 A but not 1B ?
In this case we are not setting threshold values for fixed installations , refineries or large combustion plants .
The next item is the report ( A4-0354 / 98 ) by Mr Chichester , on behalf of the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , on decommissioning of nuclear power stations and other nuclear installations in Europe .
Mr Commissioner , would you please reply to this specific question : if subsidies are not allowed for infrastructure because they do not fall within the public domain would there then not be another possibility , because intermodal installations are eligible for subsidies .
I would also ask that note be taken , on the monitors and the other technical installations , of the fact that our group is now the largest group in the Parliament , something of which many people are already aware .
Subject : Bridges across the Danube in former Yugoslavia As well as military installations , numerous civil targets were damaged or even destroyed during NATO &apos; s bombing raids in Kosovo and / or Serbia , including the bridges across the Danube , the collapsed sections of which are still obstructing navigation on the Danube and thus significantly hampering economic reconstruction .
The airstrip , the bunkhouses as well as other installations thus have a good solid foundation .
At the assembly itself , you will see many persons volunteering their help to care for needed services : installation of equipment , the preparing and serving of food , cleaning the assembly site , serving as attendants and the many other things necessary for an orderly , clean and pleasant assembly .
The construction and installation of a plant to produce about 120,000 L of alcohol per day costs about the same as drilling a petroleum well ( $ 10 million , U.S. ) , but with the guarantee of production .
Total installation of such an alcohol distillery takes about three years , whereas an oil field may require five years before it can be used commercially .
Such imposing main - frame computers , as they are called , are still very much in use in industry , business , military installations and elsewhere .
Welcomes the use of the Entebbe installation to enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of its logistical support operations for peacekeeping missions in the regions ;
Welcomes the use of the Entebbe installation to enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of its logistical support operations for peacekeeping missions in the region ;
I &apos; m a creative technologist and the focus of my work is on public installations .
In 1999 , Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission , echoing the Portuguese Presidency &apos; s statement today , sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam , there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions , and in particular Eurojust .
I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources , and I also welcome the Commission &apos; s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour , in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life .
Therefore , Madam President , in addition to calling upon you to make authoritative representations to the Slovenian Government , I also invite all the Members of Parliament to sign the declaration calling for the institution of a day dedicated to the Shoah , to the holocaust , to be observed throughout the European Union .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal for a regulation on a Community patent gives us the chance to review cooperation , as you have just said , between the European Patent Office and the Community institutions .
It would need to be accompanied by a reform to the Special Administrative Region &apos; s political institutions .
That being the case , the prevention of conflicts can not be divorced from a policy of sustainable development aimed at a better distribution of wealth and the institution of real democracy at a global level .
These measures , along with the increased vigilance of the national authorities and financial institutions , are crucial to reducing the risk of money laundering on the introduction of the euro .
Chairman , as indicated last night , the question of a rapid implementation of the EU top level domain was part and parcel of the compromise which was reached between the three institutions .
And , if the institutions are planning to compensate for the lack of employees by increasing job insecurity and sub-contracting - which is often one and the same thing - this is no better .
. ( FR ) We voted against the Theato report because the institution of a European Prosecutor would serve mainly to increase Brussels &apos; power .
An essential step has been taken , especially with the introduction of the principle of good administration , which will encourage greater cooperation and mutual help between the institutions in Member States , and will enhance the way in which citizens ’ requests for information are dealt with .
The introduction of the Europass will make it easier for workers , students , employers and educational institutions to operate in the European labour and education market .
When I say that , I am thinking about access to global public assets , the creation of global taxes , the cancellation of debt , the reform of the international financial institutions and the latter ’ s need for transparency .
With a view to modernising the EU ’ s institutions and to that implementation of sound administrative practices discussed by Commissioner Kallas , we must , however , also demand more from the tax revenue we invest .
Could you advise me on the state of the rollout of the national pilot project for the reform of institutions under ANPH , and specifically in relation to Negru Voda , and when this pilot project might be rolled out nationally ?
The advent of a European External Affairs Minister goes against the important maxim that the various institutions operate independently of one another .
It would be interesting to know what the expenditure of financial services institutions will be on analytics in the EU after the introduction of Basel II .
A feature of next year ’ s budget is once again the establishment of the new activity - based accounting system in all the institutions .
I do not , however , see any reason for the European Parliament and the other EU institutions to call on the Member States to sign the Memorandum of Understanding regarding eCall .
You have also taken the opportunity to congratulate the Commission where appropriate and to call for the introduction of an ambitious climate policy or energy policy , for example , hopefully helping us and the European institutions to work together in implementing these policies .
As a whole , too , Europe &apos; s institutions must demonstrate to European citizens that in economically sensitive areas they are able to show genuine European solidarity , so that we do not end up with a new energy solidarity stipulation , just like the introduction of the free market principle in European territory with the Services Directive .
Thus , mutual recognition of university diplomas and other formal and informal qualifications , the extension and adequate funding of European mobility programmes such as Erasmus , Comenius or Leonardo , as well as the launching of a new generation of educational curricula and institutions jointly elaborated by the Member States could contribute to the implementation of the free movement of knowledge .
The introduction of &apos; research forms &apos; in order to select researchers from a scientific institution or university in another Member State and the mobility of researchers and senior company executives will help big business to select the crème de la crème of researchers and staff its companies on terms which will boost its profitability ( flexible terms of employment , unpaid work , exemption from insurance contributions ) .
( FR ) Madam President , Mr Barroso , in February 2008 , six months before the global financial crisis , the Hungarian Prime Minister proposed the establishment of a European institution to supervise and monitor global financial trends .
I would also like to call for the establishment , at a national level , of a mechanism to assess the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy priorities and the achievement of the relevant national targets included in the National Reform Programme in order to support the annual evaluation by the EU institutions .
The amount given in the documentation that the European Union or European institutions will gain , for example , from the introduction of a financial transaction tax , is very contentious .
The results of this process are the institution of the country &apos; s legal and constitutional framework , which has almost been finalised , along with the economic reforms that have been undertaken .
It is also absolutely essential to introduce innovative incentive mechanisms , based on achieving the targets linked to smart , sustainable growth with an integration aspect , and to promote closer cooperation with the financial institutions .
The effort that the institution is making to complete the implementation of its internal control systems is already well known , but I think further endeavours ought to be made in this area in order to guarantee the transparency and reliability of the accounts .
We need a different fiscal policy that contributes to economic growth , social justice and balanced public accounts , so that it may contribute to the end of the tax benefits available in tax havens , to the taxation of profits made on the stock exchange , and to the introduction of an additional tax on the profits of large companies and financial institutions .
The Member States are faced with the task of facilitating supervision and assistance in respect of the establishment of cooperation and the exchange of information between schools , training institutions , research centres and businesses .
And we can not fail to be concerned at the fact that certain Member States are resisting both the extension of codecision to all legislative acts and the institution of qualified majority voting in the Council as the general rule .
The acceptance of the scenario for the third stage of EMU and the move to the single currency , the refusal of the governments even to re-examine EMU in the framework of the intergovernmental conference and the acceptance , even by the majority in this Parliament , of the imposition and perpetuation of a Europe of two speeds all make it manifestly obvious that the institutions of the EU are completely indifferent to the real problems and demands of Europe &apos; s peoples and are kow - towing to the dictates of large - scale capital .
All the institutions of the Union , as the budget increased , tended to participate in the creation of regulations which did not facilitate the best and the most efficient distribution of the resources which were at our disposal .
As for the joint organizational structure of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions , an amendment , which I see as important , relating to analytical accounting procedures for the standardization of accounting practices within all the institutions , was rejected .
This will allow matters to be handled less secretively and more efficiently in future , which is essential if the citizens of Europe are to regain confidence in their institutions .
The present partnership agreement with Kazakhstan , concluded for an initial period of ten years , provides for the institution of a political dialogue and cultural cooperation , together with important agreements relating to the economic and trade sectors .
These are Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 3 in part and the first paragraph of Amendment No 8 . It will defend it s new position before the Council and will do its utmost to ensure that a definitive decision can be taken before the end of the year since it is the responsibility of the Community institutions to adhere to the timetable for the introduction of the euro that was laid down two years ago by the Heads of State and of Government .
The proposed transitional period until the year 2006 during which the authorities may apply an alternative set of capital charges for commodities represent s a very sound compromise between the need to establish a common set of requirements for commodities business and the interests of individual institutions which would suffer unduly from an abrupt introduction of the new requirements .
Another crucial initiative , featuring prominently in the committee &apos; s Policy Document , is a code of conduct between financial institutions to pave the way for the smooth introduction of the euro . To this I give my full support .
We do not have a new institution in mind , but we would like to encourage registration networks on a national level .
&quot; This annual report is slightly special because it does not conform to the normal structure of that institution &apos; s annual economic reports , but is a response to the specific situation of what we could call &quot; &quot; the year of the euro &apos; s constitution &apos; . &quot;
Does the arrival of the euro , which one can assume will increase the drive among banks to expand their services throughout the Union , not also mean that the supervision of credit institutions and of their supervisory authorities , that is the national central banks , will be centralized ?
This consensus should be adopted by all the European institutions too - the Council , the Commission and Parliament - because the construction of monetary union and the euro requires very extensive , firm agreement , precisely in order to guarantee the necessary solidity and strength of the European currency , and sustainable growth of the EU economy .
I am also referring to extending the regulation to include all goods which are held under customs supervision and , finally , I am referring to the institution of a procedure to lodge a single application , which will be valid for all Member States , for the benefit of the validly registered Community trade marks .
In addition , cooperation between interested bodies , above all industry , is the determining factor in the successful institution of self - regulatory systems and filtering and rating mechanisms .
This bears clear witness to the interest devoted by your institution to the introduction of a coherent , transparent and reliable system of Community statistics .
The Commission welcomes the excellent cooperation between our two institutions , which augurs well for the imminent implementation of Article 285 of the Treaty of Amsterdam providing for the establishment of the co-decision procedure in the sphere of statistics .
It remains to be seen who will have most might , once the euro is in place , the European Union &apos; s institutions have developed and the 11 countries - soon to be more - are working together .
The transfer to the euro is not only an economic question for bankers and financial institutions .
European leaders and European Union institutions can equally point to the fact that an internal market has been put in place , allowing free movement of goods , persons , services and capital , as well as the creation of a new single currency regime which commands so much influence within the European Union itself .
However , I would ask you , in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make representations , using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Governor of Texas , Mr Bush , who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person .
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , is magnificent .
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome it s role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 -2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission &apos; s offices for several months .
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions .
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .
Mrs Theato &apos; s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions .
So far , however , the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied .
I believe that Mrs Theato &apos; s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here .
It is important that after the first step , which has already been taken , i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF , in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework .
Unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity .
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions !
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions , by protecting the Union &apos; s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community &apos; s economic life .
Mr President , rapporteur , restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us .
Accordingly , the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks , the ECB and the EIB , contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations , citing their independent status .
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions .
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union , despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote .
The European Commission &apos; s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes .
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions , and still less of improving them .
The crux of the problem is that all governments , and indeed all the European institutions , acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total - Fina and it s ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment .
The economic and social damage , which we have spoken about today , in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources , is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions .
The isolation in small communities had never helped develop complex institutions inside the region .
Many Bangladeshi institutions , which are emulated from the West fail as they ignore these cultural properties and thus fail to succeed .
But there are institutions in my country that think they can stand above the constitution and the law .
&quot; Apparently ZRA has sufficient legal tools to compel defaulting clients to pay , but the situation is tricky because of &quot; &quot; the strategic importance of the erring firms and institutions &quot; &quot; . &quot;
A two four year system is long enough to afford a determined individual as president to impact on the democratic institutions .
A legal practitioner has suggested that the review of the constitution should ensure that power resides in the hands of the people through well - structured local institutions and organs and a perfected district assembly system .
Having in their hands all the state institutions and three more years ahead of them , there are no more excuses possible .
The ultimate goal was to blockade the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and other crucial global capitalism institutions .
When this process is complete , the protest movement will have a representative body for the first time , providing a powerful , if somewhat controversial , institution that at last formalizes opposition leaders &apos; legitimacy in Russian politics .
In what is a historical step in the struggle for Roma civil rights , the residents and the owner of the buildings have joined forces with Czech activists and collectively resisted the pressure from the state institutions .
&quot; On Tuesday November 20 , the Minister of Trade , Industry and Investment , Senator Vasant Bharath , laid out his plans for the &quot; &quot; rationalization of institutions in Trinidad and Tobago &quot; &quot; at a breakfast conference hosted by the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Chamber of Industry and Commerce . &quot;
This type of appropriation of power , along with the growing exclusivity of the elites in relation to the rest of the country has a tendency give rise to political instability and calls into question the legitimacy of institutions .
Among all of the countries where similar questions have been asked , Madagascar is the one where the legitimacy of institutions ( justice , police , fiscal government ) seems to be weakest .
Public trust towards law enforcement institutions in Ukraine has reached an all time low during the recent public uprisings , known as # Euromaidan .

The West Australian quoted clergyman David Woodroffe as saying : “ Nothing now can stop the disintegration of church institutions and structures . ”
United States Attorney General John Mitchell described them as a loose conspiracy of radical and anarchist groups dedicated to the destruction of American institutions .
To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds ....
It is hard to think of anything of value that is preserved by such an institution . ”
The institution you have in mind may not be entitled to take charitable bequests through wills , and may be restricted to those for which it was created ...
McKenzie : “ In many regions where many &#91; priests &#93; do not live a celibate life , the institution of celibacy may seem to be nothing but sheer , vast hypocrisy ....
What has actually happened in the Soviet Union is just as a historian said : “ Organized religion , apart from pockets of zeal and devotion , appeared to be a dying institution . ”
Indeed , it is a dying institution even in much of the rest of the world !
Article 143 / 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code says that a person who “ in this country is joining without permission an existing international society or a society which has its headquarters outside the country or institutions or branches thereof , ” has to be punished .
Along with this vast increase in crime has come a breakdown in the very institutions one would normally look to for help .
Too frequently and too long it has appeared as a man - made , man - driven institution . ”
Understandably , a “ man - made , man - driven institution ” would latch onto that which is popular with influential men of the world , would it not ?
Phillip Converse of the University of Michigan declared : “ There has been a very progressive , alarming deterioration of trust in our institutions .
What makes the situation so frustrating for people is that in the past , when one institution failed them , they could turn to another for comfort and direction .
Fear is a controlling factor in decisions made by individuals , institutions and nations .
Not surprisingly , the family is said to be “ An Institution in Crisis . ”
So religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
They &apos; re immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering .
I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons , and I think the answer is yes .
Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness , that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions , whether we know that or not .
&quot; The president needs to stand up and say , at the end of a healthcare reform debate , &quot; &quot; Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions , clinics , hospitals and nursing homes , to the home , in 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
These two sectors , let me describe to you , have their own indigenous institutions .
What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism , but then after independence , all of a sudden , markets , capitalism became a western institution , and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism .
Go back to Africa &apos; s indigenous institutions , and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors , the traditional sectors .
The central motif of Bharti &apos; s practice is the ready - made store - bought bindi that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads , every day , in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage .
&quot; At TED2009 , Tim Berners - Lee called for &quot; &quot; raw data now &quot; &quot; -- for governments , scientists and institutions to make their data openly available on the web . At TED University in 2010 , he shows a few of the interesting results when the data gets linked up . &quot;
This particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States , of Canada , and an international institution from Syria .
I &apos; ve seen girls starving themselves to death in America in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves .
It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the East Asian Community .
We know that &apos; s wrong , because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; China seems to have been long stationary , and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions . &quot;
&quot; But this complement may be much inferior to what , with other laws and institutions , the nature of its soil , climate , and situation might admit of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
But you know , this is a TED audience , and if I keep talking about institutions , you &apos; re going to turn off .
Any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work .
That &apos; s one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations .
I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular , but also Chile , which was in many ways the one that led the way in transforming the institutions of economic life , there &apos; s a very bright future indeed .
And we &apos; ve had a classic answer for coordination costs , which is , if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people , you start an institution , right ? You raise some resources .
The classic answer is to form an institution , right ?
First of all , when you form an institution , you take on a management problem , right ?
No good just hiring employees , you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth .
Institutions only have two tools : carrots and sticks .
The costs of running the institution mean that you can not take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame .
When you &apos; re dealing with the left - hand edge of one of these distributions , when you &apos; re dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want , that &apos; s an institution - as - enabler world .
But when you &apos; re down here , where the Psycho Milts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that &apos; s institution as obstacle .
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned , we shall abstain from voting , and where , finally , the motion for a resolution is concerned , we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it .
We could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package .
These fundamental rights are thus often described as instruction standards which are implemented by authorities in social legislation .
Vague instruction standards or rights in policy areas , where the Union has no authority , must be omitted .
The Commission must judge them , but it is not our job to give instructions on this point .
Although I am merely the temporary President for this sitting , I have given instructions that the security services and the President of Parliament , Mrs Fontaine , be advised .
Nonetheless , I must also say that the regulation does not allow me , on this precise point , to issue instructions .
Madam President , given that a political group which did not participate in the negotiations of the text in question has signed the text , I would ask you , before the vote takes place , to give the appropriate instructions to the relevant administration service so that this kind of abuse does not happen again .

These instructions ( the “ program ” ) are prepared in such a way that they may be stored on magnetic tape in much the same manner that music is stored on tape , to be played back as often as desired on a home tape player .
The instructions can then be read back into the computer when it is desired for them to perform the function for which they were designed .
This process of preparing instructions for the computer to perform some task is called “ programming . ”
Now , if the designers of a computer program do not make the instructions comprehensive enough to cope with unusual occurrences and all possible eventualities , then what ?

The subject is exemption regulations , which are in force for the European insurance industry .
A regulation of this kind has existed in the field of insurance since 1992 , and expires in 2003 .
The Block Exemption Regulation for the insurance industry lays down and permits common rules governing agreement on the calculation of premiums , the stipulation of policy conditions , joint coverage of certain types of risk , and safety precautions .
All in all , I can say that Parliament is satisfied with this interim report and that it expects the Commission to make continuous progress on this matter and achieve an end result for the insurance industry within the framework of the exemption regulations in force , all of which expire in 2002 and 2003 , including for other areas .
What that draws to our attention , in a philosophical way , is that even in a competitive market , insurance is inherently a collective activity in which people share risks among themselves .
If I might make a remark about a currently controversial topic in my own country , I think it is a pity to see such vigorous efforts being made to de- mutualise excellent old mutual assurance companies which fully express the collective aspect of insurance , and I am sad to think of a raid being made on the Standard Life in this way .

National systems of health care , and even the supervision of health insurance , are regulated at national level , but that does not mean that we are not all dealing with the same problems .
For instance , we see that in the US system , health costs as measured against gross domestic product are nearly twice as high as the EU average , and that in the United States there are still some 40 million people who have inadequate health insurance .
It would be wrong if the EU were to devise rules concerning , for example , data relating to health , or requiring everyone to be insured and , in that way , destroy the multiplicity of supplementary health insurance schemes which exist today in many countries and operate on actuarial principles .
&quot; So an absolute &quot; &quot; one size fits all &quot; &quot; solution for insurance is unlikely to be the answer . &quot;
I therefore believe we should lend our support to what Mr Rocard has put in his report - and we congratulate him on it - asking the Commission to provide a service , a Green Paper which will enable us to see the current insurance situation in the Member States and also to define the future .

However , I do not see any risk of art markets relocating to Switzerland or the USA , since the insurance and transport costs exceed the costs involved in the right of resale and make it unprofitable to relocate .

The global rich have stable governments , savings accounts , insurance and more to fall back on when disaster strikes .
CHIRPS is playing a role in bringing insurance to climate - vulnerable regions for the first time , too .
The basic idea is that subsistence farmers can purchase the right to financial compensation during low rainfall years through insurance programs sponsored by governments and climate - focused aid agencies .
With the advent of CHIRPS , this type of insurance could become available faster to rural areas in need around the world .

Term life insurance is not for the purpose of building cash value for use in future years .
Term insurance provides the maximum protection for the premium dollar .
Also , insurance companies pay interest on the cash value building up in a policy .
Unlike most term insurance policies , one can allow a whole life policy to lapse and still be covered .
The law provides that cash abandoned in such a policy is not forfeited , but automatically buys term insurance in the face amount of the policy for as long a time as the cash affords .
Everyone would like to cut insurance costs without cutting out the policy .

Fear of crime creeps into more and more of life ’ s activities : the kind and amount of insurance we buy , when and where we walk , whether we go alone , and so on .
For example , the rearing of children is viewed by them somewhat like taking out an insurance policy .
Knowledge of this percentage is the basis for determining the rates that each group pays for its insurance ; only a certain percentage , the rates indicate , will have to be paid off in varying amounts through the years .

Mr President , Commissioner , for ten years , a whole world of citizens , politicians and journalists have taken an active interest in , and been horrified by , the fate of Aung San Suu Kyi .
In my opinion , therefore , the main issue at stake is not whether we grant a debt deferment , debt reduction , debt moratorium or suchlike , but whether debts are cancelled , as these countries need the money that at present they spend almost exclusively on interest – not even on repayment – to tackle their economic , social and environmental problems .
In 2003 Directive 2003 / 49 / EC was adopted , eliminating double taxation for interest and royalty payments between associated enterprises from different Member States , which authorises only the country of the beneficial owner of the payment to tax that payment .
Will countries still be able , at national level , to pursue certain economic policies , interest and exchange rate policies , regional and labour market policies , and so on ?
Failure to approve this proposal for a directive would mean an increase of 0.25 % in interest and amortization costs , which certainly can not be justified at the present stage .
What this dogmatism , the Commission &apos; s conception of the importance of interest rates and currency , actually means is that one might justifiably borrow the words of the old populist US politician William Jennings Brian , in saying that monetary union will crucify the people of Europe on a cross of gold .

Canadian doctor Sir William Osler claimed : “ No man is really happy or safe without a hobby , ” adding : “ It makes precious little difference what the outside interest may be ...

“ Continue to love your enemies and to do good and to lend without interest , not hoping for anything back , and your reward will be great , and you will be sons of the Most High , because he is kind toward the unthankful and wicked .

We note , first of all , that the committee considers the data , as presented in the Commission &apos; s annual report , to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in - depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate , sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition , pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty .
In this area , the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action : acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices , by refocusing its departments &apos; supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law .

Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps , as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring .
What is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this .
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority , rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests , that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity .
At the same time , it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community &apos; s financial interests , as Mrs Theato has explained very well .
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community . But be careful .

I was thrilled to learn of Jehovah God , whose kingdom will soon take possession of the earth and give to all obedient inhabitants of the earth real peace and happiness along with everlasting life .
He said : “ Not everyone saying to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens , but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will .
Also , Christ said , as recorded at John 18 : 36 : ‘ My kingdom is no part of this world .
So God sends forth “ this good news of the kingdom ” to the world , not to convert it , but as a “ witness , ” a warning affording people opportunity to choose .
Beginning in 768 , upon the death of his father , Pepin the Short , Charlemagne shared the kingdom of the Franks with his brother .

To them the words of Jesus at Matthew 25 : 34 will apply : “ Come , you who have been blessed by my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world . ”
Instead , they ‘ seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness . ’
The demand for the printed message of the Kingdom was that great !
The contenders are , on the one side , all human governments of the whole earth and , on the other side , God ’ s own government , his promised kingdom by his Son , Christ Jesus .
Their misuse of earth will result in a head - on collision with the one government able to accomplish God ’ s will toward this earth , his kingdom by his Son .
You will thereby show that you really mean it when you pray to God : “ Let your kingdom come .
“ God has chosen to call apart a people as his instrument for bringing in his Kingdom ... the redemption of the world is , among other things , a political redemption ....

There should be no falling - off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years , and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead .
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed , not only in the case of lead , cadmium and mercury , but also in the case of waste which contains PVC .
We know that lead , mercury , cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made .
The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances ( lead , cadmium , mercury , hexavalent chrome , PVC and halogenated flame retarders ) .
The European Parliament and the European Council at conciliation have also agreed that all vehicles placed on the market after 1 July 2003 should not contain any heavy metals such as cadmium or lead .

We believe that similar action should be taken with regard to lead and organotin .
Chlorine is one of its main components . Lead and cadmium are used as stabilisers , and phthalates are added to make the material more supple .
Hazardous stabilisers in the form of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium must be banned as soon as possible .
We think it only reasonable to specify a year after which cadmium is no longer to be used , just as has been done in the case of lead .
The use of lead is also becoming less common .
Lead is toxic when ingested as a compound , but no one would suggest that it is risky to be in a room which has PVC windows , this is an inert substance .
If we ban the use of lead in new windows , we will not be able to recycle the old windows when they come into the waste stream .
The weak points of the Green Paper are that it mentions products , such as cadmium and lead , which industry actually uses only very rarely in the PVC production process even now .
Industry &apos; s repeated request to exclude certain options from the process of reflection - such as , for example , substituting PVC with alternatives or finding replacements for the stabilisers cadmium and lead - must be refused .
In its assessment , the Commission will mainly concentrate on the use of certain PVC additives , lead , cadmium and phthalates , as well as the treatment of PVC waste in accordance with the commitment the Commission made in its proposal for a directive on end - of - life vehicles .
In principle , the proposal to substitute lead , mercury , cadmium , etc. is welcomed .
Two dilemmas have been pointed out concerning lead and brominated flame retardants .
The directives deal with producer responsibility , separate collection , better treatment , reuse , recycling , costs , targets , labelling , alternatives to dangerous substances such as lead , mercury , PBB , etc . , while allowing some exceptions .

Mr President , this report rightly seeks to limit the use of hazardous substances , including lead , in electrical and electronic equipment .
However , I would like to inform Mr Florenz that , where lead is concerned - as the Italian proverb says - it is better to have leaden feet , that is to go slowly .
I am saying this because , apart from anything else , many politicians and ministers in Europe have their pockets full of lead : so much so that they are unable to stand up from their chairs !

It is therefore not sensible to ban lead in the glass of light bulbs .
For reasons of safety , I am in favour of the use of lead in television tubes .
Yet , these products contain toxic substances that are harmful to the environment such as lead , cadmium and mercury .
The second directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment concerns the ban on the use of certain extremely harmful substances such as lead , mercury , cadmium and hexavalent chromium in the manufacture of electric and electronic equipment .
There are perhaps two issues which are the most controversial amongst the various groups : the first is the levels of concentration of lead , cadmium , mercury and chromium present in packaging and the second is the particular percentage of recycling and recovery for each of the materials proposed .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is right to want to recycle at least 65 % of the weight , completely ban the use of lead , cadmium , mercury or hexavalent chromium from 2007 and to subject new packaging material to stricter requirements from 2004 .
Sulphur is the poison for catalytic converters , just as lead was the poison for first - generation catalytic converters .
The second part is the question of how we are to deal with hazardous substances such as cadmium , lead and hexavalent chromium in future .

For example , if we find equal amounts of lead and uranium , we know that one half - life , that is , 4.5 billion years , has passed .
Note that we do not have to know how much uranium was in the rock to start with because all we have to measure is the proportion of lead to uranium at the end of the period — which is just as well because none of us were around to measure anything at the beginning of the experiment .
We mentioned that the rock has to be free from lead at the beginning .
Over long periods of time , some of the lead or the uranium might seep out into groundwater .
Or more uranium or lead might get in , especially if it is a sedimentary rock .
Other complications arise from the fact that another element , thorium , which may be in the mineral , is also radioactive and slowly disintegrates into lead .
says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies , and this includes preservatives , pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury .

The wings of these fleet - footed speedsters , though useless for flight , help to give lift to the bird ’ s heavy body as it runs , enabling it to reach a top speed of 40 miles an hour !
To facilitate lift , the wing is slightly concave on the underside and curved upward on the topside .
To create lift , we simply heat the air inside it .
Similarly , air moving around the specially shaped wings of a bird provides enough upward lift to counter the pull of gravity and prevent the creature from falling to the ground .
The compressed “ thicker ” air under the wing exerts greater pressure and pushes the bird up , providing the needed lift .
Wing movement provides lift as well as the propulsion needed to overcome “ drag ” and to gain speed .
The faster the bird travels , the more lift will come from the air passing around the wings .
Others , such as the vultures , land on a tree or fence and then , by jumping off , gain enough speed through the pull of gravity for their wings to provide lift .
Although man can produce gliders and now supersonic jet planes , he has been unable to imitate precisely the flapping of a bird ’ s wings , which can produce both propulsion and lift .
A group of feathers at the leading edge of the wing prevent turbulence that would cause loss of lift .
There are four forces that act on an airplane in flight : ( 1 ) gravity ( the natural force acting on its weight to pull it to the ground ) , ( 2 ) lift ( opposite of gravity and produced by the design of the wings or updrafts of air ) , ( 3 ) drag ( air resistance opposing forward movement ) , ( 4 ) thrust ( forward power to overcome drag and propel the airplane forward ) .
Lift is provided by ( 1 ) the curved design of the wings and ( 2 ) the rising currents of air .
From studying the shape of birds ’ wings man came to recognize that a curved shape would provide lift .
Wind that is deflected upward by hills or mountains can give lift , as can the waves of air produced on the leeward side of high mountains .
If cool , heavy air moves into an area of warmer air , the warmer air is forced upward and these “ shear lines ” can be used for lift .
Low speeds are inherently possible with a soaring or gliding flight , but extra lift is necessary .
The bird ’ s large wings and its weight ( giving added momentum ) supply this needed lift .
Perhaps even more fascinating are flight feathers , the “ propellers ” that provide lift and movement of the bird through the air .
With the lift of the air petering out , the bird turns toward its destination .
At the same time , the flow of the wind over the wings imparts lift .
At best their efforts do little more than offer a temporary emotional lift .
It gave me an important psychological lift right from the start to know that he was not in full control of himself or me .
These insects generate so much lift that the American magazine National Wildlife recently described the way they fly as “ an aerodynamic miracle . ”
But it is the dragonfly ’ s ability to “ tap the power of the whirlwind , ” as National Wildlife puts it , that creates such “ phenomenal lift . ”
On a helicopter , however , the lift is generated by rotating the rotor blades , which are comparable to wings .
A decrease in lift causes the machine to descend .
The resultant low pressure above the wing produces lift , drawing the insect upward .
If the vortex died out , the moth would lose lift and plummet to the ground .
Instead , the swirl of air travels along the wing ’ s leading edge to the wing tip , and the lift thus generated by the downstroke , equivalent to one and a half times the moth ’ s weight , allows the insect to fly with ease .
Aeronautical engineers already knew that delta - wing aircraft ( so - called because the wing resembles the Greek letter Δ ) produce vortices at their wingtips , which create lift .

Mr President , on a point of order , the reason why the lifts did not appear to be working was that the security guards were standing at the bottom with about three of them blocked off , apparently for some delegation that is visiting Parliament !
Because this building is so badly designed , the lifts barely have enough capacity for Members as it is , without the security guards taking over two or three of them at precisely the time when everybody is coming down to vote .
The only assurance I can give you is that the President was not blocking a lift .

I too have been stuck in the lift a few times .
A few thoughts , now , on the lifts .
Mr President , in my first speech in this Chamber , I had hoped to speak about linking the banks of lifts electronically to make them more efficient , about ventilation in the bathrooms , about the air conditioning and about the dog - sick carpets in the bar areas .

Architectural cultural heritage , land developed and cultivated by man and urban cultural heritage belong together , but the picture is not complete unless it also includes monuments to contemporary history , from the world of work for example , such as developments in working life , the building of factories , machines and so on and so forth .
Well then , I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this debate to condemn another incident : since 15 September 2000 , three Italian citizens , engineers employed by a company which makes sweet - making machines , have been in the hands of the National Liberation Army .
One only has to mention , somewhere in a sentence , the need to respect subsidiarity , and the machine can rumble on its way as if nothing had happened .
We are , of course , aware of the suspicions that this requirement could give rise to , as it would require considerable investment in tools , machines and items to ensure that the money is legal , but it is essential from the point of view of protecting citizens .
A computer is only a machine , a tool .
Children are being abducted to be trained as soldiers , to carry weapons , to become a killing machine or to provide sexual services .
Mr President , we have had an almost permanent Intergovernmental Conference for 10 years , we have had endless debates on the nature of the European Union and even on its raison d &apos; être . The European Union increasingly resembles one of these useless machines seen in contemporary art , where the only important thing is the complexity of its workings .
In truth , noise and the activities which create noise - there is nothing more horrendous than a machine digging a hole in the street , and not allowing us to live - are mostly subsidiary . They come within the competence of local authorities , and it is therefore very difficult to get different towns to agree , for example , on closing times for bars , because they all want to compete .
Or we know that , on some days in June this year , 40 % of carbon monoxide emissions originated from these mobile machines , 40 % of the ozone precursors .
They must have been conscious of landing risks of that type of machine in those conditions .
This is a self - aware machine that must continually find a reason to be relevant .
So I took a pen and designed a machine Egypt needs in this phase
Gradually , these voices will be extinguished , choked by the mass media machine that post dispatches written hastily , with information disseminated before being fully verified .
I Fell Asleep Too , because we are not machines but human beings like everyone else
There were no big - data machines or service providers digging into our data and online behaviors and there were no algorithms shaping what we read and when .
My father told me that when democracy returned they brought in machines to remove the remains , they ground them up and dumped them , I don ’ t know where .
Impressive as these complex machines may be , it is the glassblower who truly enthralls the watcher .
Finally , the paint is moved to automatic machines that fill , cover and code the containers .
New methods of farming , ingenious machines , commercial fertilizers , better seed stock and fresh varieties boosted crop production .
Meanwhile , cattle - fattening feedlots have sprung up — feedlots where no barn is needed , no farm residence , but simply elevators for feed storage , outdoor cattle stalls and machines that distribute the feed to such stalls .
A similar situation can exist in a factory where a man is put on a machine without sufficient training and supervision .
On a smooth surface the cyclist with this machine could go almost as fast as a horseman .
That is why he alone can build and use machines , computers — even rocket himself to the moon .
We have been told that it is the largest one of its kind in Canada and that such machines are a major factor in successful strip mining .
“ These control the cables that work the boom and bucket on the front of the machine .
The boom rises , the entire machine swings on it s base and the bucket is tipped , allowing the dirt to fall on the spoil pile beside the open cut . ”
Now we climb another set of metal stairs , this time to the small operator ’ s cab , which sits in an upper front corner of the machine .
As we make our way down toward the exit we marvel at how such a monstrous machine could move across the landscape .
You might think that this digging machine must be the largest one in the world , but not so .
The efficiency with which these machines remove overburden to reach the coal makes strip mining practical .
The defects may be one of two kinds , namely , impurities such as stones or twigs that were not eliminated by machine or hand sorting , and defects in the beans themselves due to poor farming methods .
They are a network of small computing machines , working in networks .
Hybrid means it &apos; s something that &apos; s half living and half machine .
The connection with the machine is much more easy , much more even ethically possible .
whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity -- we &apos; ll build them , we &apos; ll turn on the machines and , bang , we &apos; ll catch it -- the first song from space .
What I &apos; m going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body .
So DNA &apos; s entering the production line from the left - hand side , and it hits this collection , these miniature biochemical machines , that are pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy .
Now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you , copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity .
In the 1970s and 1980s , a generous spirit suffused the Internet , whose users were few and far between . But today , the net is ubiquitous , connecting billions of people , machines and essential pieces of infrastructure -- leaving us vulnerable to cyber - attack or meltdown . Internet pioneer Danny Hillis argues that the Internet wasn &apos;t designed for this kind of scale , and sounds a clarion call for us to develop a Plan B : a parallel system to fall back on if -- or when -- the Internet crashes .
And so I &apos; ve been beginning , with a variety of different projects , to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes .
In that we &apos; re unique , and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine .
OK now . Arthur &#91; Ganson &#93; hasn &apos;t talked yet , but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside . And so , we -- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson .
Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin offer a peek inside the Google machine , sharing tidbits about international search patterns , the philanthropic Google Foundation , and the company &apos; s dedication to innovation and employee happiness .
And instead of installing the large - scale machines used by western producers , they used low - cost CAD / CAM prototyping technology .
After this , we wanted to see if we could implement this and automate the system , so we used the same system but we added a structure to it so we could activate the machine .
So , this small machine that you &apos; ve seen , we &apos; re hoping to make small toys like one - meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade -- so replace the remote control parts by Androids , so the mobile phone , and Arduino micro-controller , so you could be controlling this from your mobile phone , your tablet .
Then what we want to do is create six - meter versions so we can test the maximum performance of these machines , so we can go at very , very high speed .
It is essentially the stuff of life meets machine .
Here &apos; s how it goes . In CERN , Geneva , Switzerland , a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider .
It &apos; s a machine that will send particles around a tunnel , opposite directions , near the speed of light .
You put together machines and water , and you get landscapes that look like this . And then you get sales that look like this . It &apos; s brute force . So what you &apos; ve been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that &apos; s a reasonably natural system . You start taming that natural system . You put a lot of force behind that natural system . You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides -- -- behind that natural system , and you end up with systems that look like this .
Madam President , coinciding with this year &apos; s first part - session of the European Parliament , a date has been set , unfortunately for next Thursday , in Texas in America , for the execution of a young 34 year - old man who has been sentenced to death . We shall call him Mr Hicks .

I would like to tell you that , in fact , it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem . There are men and women who depend on fishing , gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas .
&apos;Mainstreaming &apos; means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy , strategy and measures .
They concern access to training , the ratio of men to women with access to training , and special action for the long - term unemployed .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your reply , although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet , since this matter is of the greatest importance . We trusted this Commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women .
I hope that , in the future , things will change and meetings will become frequent , because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude , as quickly as possible , those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women .

The aim should be that Parliament and the Council agree on priorities concerning the use of left - over margins , and that a procedure should be agreed in order to make any changes to these principles .
We are still within the 20 % margin which we set ourselves and we are keeping to it .
In this year &apos; s recommendations we have taken particular account of the Commission &apos; s own analyses regarding what the margins are , and which benchmarks we are setting in each of the Member States to tackle the crisis without exceeding the 3 % public deficit , which is the figure we have established as a reference .
This aid only represents 0.18 % of the total budget of the EAGGF - Guarantee and 0.16 % of the total agricultural budget , for which , furthermore , it has been pointed out that there is a sufficient financial margin .
This will leave a margin in the financial perspectives of EUR 69.1 million .
We therefore decided to fund it using the margin which totals 21 million in this heading .
Budgetary history works in our favour in this case and by using almost this entire margin , this initiative can be financed without any reduction or transfer from other appropriations , which is highly satisfactory .
This gives us room for manoeuvre within the margin which we set for ourselves in category 5 and ensures that we can use the money reasonably and sustainably for parliamentary work and not for interest payments as part of our building policy , which is why the PPE will , of course , be voting in favour of both the Bourlanges and Virrankoski reports .
However , we must find this 20 million by squeezing the margin dry .
We can not use the 3.2 billion ; instead we must squeeze the margin dry .
I should like to thank the rapporteurs and to tell the rapporteur , Mr Bourlanges , that the Commission has accepted all Parliament &apos; s proposed amendments , even where , for example in the case of Montenegro , the remaining margin is extremely tight , but that means we must be economical and that is what we intend to be .
While the service providers benefit from the largest part of the commercial margin and are free to choose the most profitable sectors , the rail companies on the other hand are left to bear the high equipment and personnel costs .
For expenditure related to rural development , taking account of the delays which have built up in the approval and implementation of national rural development plans , the Council felt that a margin of EUR 225 million , under the ceiling of sub-category 1 b of the financial perspectives , could be earmarked .
So the draft budget drawn up by the Council includes margins available under the ceilings of sub-categories 1 a and 1 b of the financial perspectives .
For this very reason , I wish to state from the outset that I share the concerns expressed by the rapporteur a few minutes ago on the situation of the loan guarantee reserve , whose narrow margin could cause problems should any unforeseen events occur .
When the Commission put forward a proposal , in late spring , to take the EUR 300 million required for the revision of heading 4 from the margin left in heading 1 , the Council vehemently resisted this straightaway .
On no account was the margin to be reduced !
Our margin will allow us to pitch the level of reconstruction aid EUR 50 million higher than the figure decided by the Council .
In identifying margins for manoeuvre , notably as regards the ceiling set for heading 3 and heading 4 , it is also been the Council &apos; s intention to let Parliament , which has the final say on non-compulsory expenditure , set out its priorities without calling into question the Council &apos; s priorities .
The Commission proposed a margin of EUR 137 million below the ceiling , but the Council has upped this to EUR 208 million .
The first is the assessment of needs , the second an examination of the margins available within the framework of the existing ceilings , and the third the possible use of budgetary tools that can be harnessed prior to any revision , such as that of flexibility .
With the budget and also with the draft budget for 2001 , we are now a good EUR 20 billion below this 1.27 margin , and I should like to make it clear to my fellow MEPs that it does not make sense to engage in useless expenditure .
In some areas of agricultural activity , such as bee production , EU support represents the profit margin which in effect means consumers enjoy a quality food product at production costs and regretfully , as demonstrated in recent years , sometimes below the cost of production .
On the question of fair price , the price charge for access to the local loop must be allowed to reflect sunken costs in addition to a margin for reinvestment .

You all know that , unfortunately , there is no margin , especially not in 1 b .
The immediate Budget problem is that there is a danger of there being no margin left in the guarantee fund reserve .

When we make use of 1.06 per cent of the Member States &apos; GDP , this gives us a margin greater than ever before and greater than that predicted in Berlin less than two years ago .
On Mr Mulder &apos; s comment : you noted that , because the budget at second reading was below the margin in agricultural policy , the risk of a change in exchange rates needed to be included in the calculation , because it would be not unwelcome if the euro were to rise against the dollar .
If the price falls below a specific margin , the meat from male cattle at least , must be compulsorily purchased by the European Union .
The margin in its financial perspective has been almost used up as a result of the BSE crisis .
The present SAB 2 for 2001 , as Markus Ferber mentioned earlier , is causing some people concern , not just about the needs of the Council in that SAB but also about what it is going to do to the margin of Category 5 . When we had the trialogue last Thursday , the Swedish Presidency took on board , and were very amenable to , what we were saying .
We stressed that there is a need for the three institutions to get together as soon as possible to start talking about the margins - especially in Category 5 , but we have to start looking at Categories 3 and 4 as well .
I would like to thank Mrs Buitenweg for her report , which makes it clear that the margin for administrative expenditure is rather tight and that successful cooperation is therefore needed if we are to get by here in future .
However , we are concerned about two proposed amendments , both on the same subject , namely that investments should be excluded when calculating the Stability and Growth Pact margins .
Finally , it should be noted that the margin for &apos; Administrative Expenditure &apos; in heading 5 is now only EUR 34 million .
In internal policies ( category 3 ) , the current margin is limited and the broad economic guidelines lay down clear priorities in this area , which must be respected .
Mr President , enlargement will increase pressure on the margin of the budget .
To those honourable Members who have been seriously concerned about the margin of category 5 , I can say by way of reassurance that that this afternoon &apos; s vote on the schedule of part - sessions for next year at any rate turned out very favourably financially .
Could say a little more about the specific actions that will be undertaken within this new GSP scheme and the particular margins that might be anticipated on that particular issue ?
If it suits the purchasers and the old shareholders , they are closed because their profit margin lags behind the rest of the group , because their brand name can be stuck on other products or their production can be transferred to a country with low wages and inadequate environmental regulation .
To this day , we can only remark that the preliminary draft budget put forward by the Commission exceeds the category 5 ceilings of 5 million and that Council is now putting forward a draft budget where these ceilings are most certainly respected , with a margin of 58 million , but where all the policies of the different institutions would not , as a result of this , be respected .
The Council has ensured , insofar as is possible , that sufficiently wide margins will be maintained in respect of the maximum amounts for the different categories , with the exception of categories 2 and 7 .
Moreover , as I explained a moment ago , the Council failed to adopt the principle of a reserve of EUR one billion , which the Commission had proposed in order to cover the effects of the BSE and FMD crises , and increase the margin in the process .
Nevertheless , the Council has added a margin of EUR 100 million under the maximum of category 4 of the financial perspectives , which will enable you to confirm your priorities in this sector .
The draft budget provides for a margin of EUR 53 million under the maximum of category 5 of the financial perspectives . This is to enable accommodation of fresh needs in the field of administrative expenditure , and the European data protection monitor , in particular .
In my capacity as permanent rapporteur for these matters I would , in this connection , like to express my concern that next year the Guarantee Fund will have no margin whatsoever for new and unexpected aid actions .
Russia will indeed get its loan , but another country will not , as a 100 % guarantee needlessly eats into the margin in the Guarantee Fund set aside for others .
This margin should be sufficient to cover priorities , some of which , including e-learning and immigration , will undoubtedly be mentioned by your rapporteur or , in any event , will be suggested at our forthcoming dialogue .
For example , the Council has created a margin of EUR 100 million under the ceiling of heading 4 of the financial perspectives , which should enable us to shore up the priorities in this sector .
The letter of amendment that we will be laying before you concludes by saying that we can release the reserve and that we require less expenditure on agriculture than our calculations had originally provided for , so that a fairly substantial margin remains .
So , in my judgment , caution demands that we keep this margin in this area .
Problems are needlessly exacerbated by the way the Council acts , for , this year too , the Budget is below the margin , far under 1.27 % of Gross Social Product , despite special tasks , preparations for enlargement and many other problems .
As the permanent rapporteur on loans and guarantees in the Committee on Budgets , I would like once more to draw attention to the fact that next year there will be no margin whatsoever in the Guarantee Funds for new and unexpected aid actions .
This is a fragile sector , in which the profit margins have been extremely low in recent years .
As Parliament demanded , there is now open quantitative declaration , and , although the 15 % is in my opinion at the upper edge of the margin , consensus has nonetheless been reached .
Even with the Council , which did not originally share this position , a compromise text could eventually be agreed on , according to which the ingredients must now be stated by percentage of weight with a margin for error and according to which farmers must be given the exact percentages if they request them .
The Council also wanted to leave open a wide margin under the maximum of Heading 4 &apos; External action &apos; with a view to meeting possible future needs in those regions .
Additionally , in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement , it has managed to ensure that within the maximum amounts of financial perspectives , margins remain available , as a result of which different Community measures and policy lines can be prioritised .
In second reading , we have left an ample margin for assistance to Afghanistan and neighbouring regions , and with the Council we have agreed on the figure of EUR 488 million for cooperation with developing countries in Asia .
I also see it as good news that a preliminary draft Budget , despite the many new demands that are made on it , can be set out in such a way that there remains a large margin for unforeseen eventualities , and that this can also be captured within the financial perspective .
I have already referred to agriculture , in which area there is , according to the Commission proposal , a margin of EUR 2.3 billion , meaning that the Commission &apos; s preliminary draft remains EUR 2.3 billion under the maximum set for agriculture in the financial perspective .
That does not , though , represent a risk to the Budget , as the large margin will remain and will be able to take it up .
A further point we need to discuss , and which the Commissioner too mentioned , is , naturally , foreign policy , for which the Commission proposes a budget margin of EUR 60 million .
Now , of course , that has seen a great deal of movement over recent weeks , meaning that the margin in heading 1 for agriculture has already been reduced by between EUR 400 million and EUR 500 million .
That is why there has to be a margin available .
I shall deal very briefly with foreign policy , with regard to which I am already able to announce that the Commission is preparing to use this year &apos; s Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 to top up the margin of EUR 70 million , which is still there for foreign policy .
Last year , Parliament and the Council left this amount in the margin , stating that it should be used only when more precise information on a programme for Afghanistan became available .
Alongside the Community Disaster Fund , which the Commission has proposed and which will mobilise aid money in the long term , there is a need for emergency aid supplied from the margin of as yet unused European budget resources .
Mr Haarder drew attention to this July &apos; s agreement to the effect that we must not increase the payments more than is necessary , and he even wants us to leave margins .
In view of the fact that in category 4 , i.e. foreign policy , we only have a very small margin available overall , we must decide whether there will be further cuts here .
I explicitly welcome the reinstatement of these appropriations and should like in addition to underline that the Commission &apos; s PDB had already provided for a margin of EUR 2.26 billion below the financial perspective ceiling that was set in Berlin .
This actually ought to have the effect of substantially reducing the anticipated margin in the current agriculture budget .
You speak about transparency , but the pharmaceutical industry has always kept its margins under wraps , which are amongst some of the highest in industry , due to the very fact that they are guaranteed by the national health systems .
ICES , the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea , is keen to reduce the catch quota of flatfish even further , while the safe margin is in sight .
By various stages , these were subsequently reduced , giving us a manageable surplus and what I deem to be a wholly acceptable margin for the next budgetary year .
It means that we are now entering a new budget year with a fairly broad margin which will hopefully amount to slightly more than EUR 20 million .
In Berlin , the precaution was taken of creating a margin in order to make enlargement possible and easier .
Will the Commission take account of those profit margins to which public reference is made , namely 85 % for certain types of software ?
A lot of young people use them , perhaps even our sons and daughters , but many of these drugs are not innocent - certainly not if they have been tampered with to increase the profit margin even further .
American protectionism has consequences for all of us , which led Arcelor to impose market regulation , in other words according to its own criteria , with a view to reassuring its shareholders , who were hungry for high profit margins .
Let us remember finally that if this preferential treatment is withdrawn , it is the European importer that has to pay the duty in question , perhaps by cutting his margin slightly , and we all know that in the case of an importer this is usually comfortable .
The WTO then promises them free access to the world market . Due to the law of supply and demand , however , market value is unstable and , when prices fall , the multinationals that control the market take steps to preserve their profit margins .
The unilateral application by the EU of the principles established in the 1994 OECD agreement , intended to end aid to the shipbuilding industry , was one of the main causes , since the current temporary defence mechanism proved to be inadequate in the face of the unfair competition and dumping by South Korean shipyards , which have negative margins that vary from 20 % to 40 % , supported by State aid .
With the exception of the Structural Funds , the preliminary draft budget leaves margins , that is room for manoeuvre , in all areas .
We have noted that there is a 1.4 billion margin in the budget .
The Commission &apos; s proposal would benefit the food industry and distribution , which will be able to increase their profit margins by buying raw materials more cheaply .
The price is so low that there is very little profit margin .
Private companies want to make a profit , and in the short term , the profit margins on social housing are tiny .
Since many firms today operate with very little margin of profit , poor work attitudes among employees may contribute to a company ’ s going bankrupt .
Then you can go even further , almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements , double the big haulers &apos; margins .
So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain , and went to a low - margin , high - volume , absolutely certain - payment business .
We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way , day one , which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars .
CA : That &apos; s a high gross margin business . I like it .
The productive margin in our governments &apos; search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy , it lies with international donors .
You have found at the heart of European democracy the capacity to take someone from one of the smallest groups and smallest states and say that , in contemporary European democracy , there is a place to include all , including those on the geographic or other margins .
While the Commission proposals for a further reform of the CAP are likely to be more compatible with Third World development needs , I fear that our aspirations to protect Community farmers , particularly those on the margins , are not going to be easy to achieve .
However , the amount of the preliminary draft budget , with payment appropriations which do not exceed 0.99 % , unfortunately reflects the glaring inconsistency between the challenges in the sector of research , innovation and competitiveness and the narrow margins allowed by the budget .
The EU budget needs to make full use of the financial margins to respond to the economic crisis .
Intervention measures in support of currencies experiencing difficulties should be automatic when a currency reaches its fluctuation margin and possible before it does so , provided that such measures are justified by fundamental economic factors , and that their volume does not run counter to the objective of achieving price stability .
Taking as his starting point a fact which is nothing particularly unusual in the context of agricultural production and prices , the rapporteur demonstrates that regular overestimates of the order of 10 % take place at the end of each financial year , and that it is therefore not desirable to retain such a large safety margin for the purposes of administration .

The Environment Council &apos; s conclusions will also deal with the question of a decision concerning the EU &apos; s proposal in the negotiations on emissions reductions for international aviation and maritime transport , develop the EU &apos; s strategy for measures in developing countries with regard to measurement , reporting and verification of investments and the role of sectoral mechanisms , and will further develop the EU &apos; s strategy to combat deforestation and forest degradation in order to speed up the negotiations .

For this reason , and before the measures are adopted as standard for energy , we would have to ensure the adoption of this strategic action , as well as the reliability of the means of production of gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect , so that we can efficiently monitor the development of the problem in all countries .
The concept of quality in education is more than a quantitative measure of the resources of the different systems or an evaluation of performance in certain academic disciplines .

The proposals in Mrs Theato &apos; s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection , under criminal law , of our financial interests , which would criminalise certain activity , specifically fraud against the Community budget .

On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting .
I am however afraid that the usual double standards may make these measures meaningless , for how credible are policies which would restrict the fight for human dignity to some parties and leave out others ?

Consideration might be given to earmarking a certain proportion of companies &apos; production costs for this purpose , a specific percentage of the State budget , a particular portion of normal working hours or , if appropriate , a certain number of the individual &apos; s working hours . Alternatively , other similar quantitative measures might be made use of .

I feel that as well as promoting the fairness that underpins changes in policy , systems of derogation and specific measures , in other words dealing in the same way with things that are the same and differently with things that are different , the important thing is that in my region , as in the other outermost regions , people should be able to live in dignity .

To delay , or perhaps even risk damage to the euro , would be indefensible . It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new , unfamiliar notes .
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002 , everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro .
As has already been mentioned , the stage we are now at is that the euro has already been introduced , but the public will only have the bank notes in their hands on 1 January 2002 .
1 January 2002 , which is not far away , is the key date for the circulation of euro notes and coins within the territories of all the EMU participating countries .
Mr President , for most Europeans , the era of the euro will not actually begin until they are required to use euro coins and notes in the shops .
- ( PT ) Mr President , it seems that since the launch of the euro in January 1999 , the European public , far from becoming more interested in it , has in fact been losing interest , as if the extremely long period of three years without notes and coins has turned the euro into a kind of virtual reality .
Yet in 18 months &apos; time our national notes and coins will disappear and it is high time that we were totally familiar with the new money , developed a sense of it s value and recognised its implications for our lives and for the development of our economies and societies .
Firstly , the communication is part of a very complex operation , that is , the introduction of the euro , in the form of coins and notes , on 1 January 2002 .
We are , however , eighteen months away from a crucial deadline : the withdrawal of national currencies and the start of the physical circulation of euro notes and coins .
It is therefore important that the necessary information should be made available , and more information should of course be made available than we receive whenever countries at present introduce new designs on notes and coins .
For them everything continues as usual . These countries are preparing everything to change their notes and coins .
Four hundred and fifty - three days from now , euro notes will enter into circulation .
As I have stated in my report , this automation and standardisation process should be in place three months before the introduction of notes and coins .
When euro coins and notes are introduced on 1 January 2002 , consumers will start to use the euro frequently , and how are we then to explain that there are differences in its use , even though there is one currency and one euro area ?
This promised benefit has not materialised ; and indeed , as the Commission candidly admitted when this report was discussed in committee , no improvement is expected in the situation after the introduction of notes and coins .
We now hear that the printers responsible for producing the notes are threatening to go on strike .
After all , on that fateful day , 1 January 2002 , all citizens of the euro area will have the same coins and notes in their purses and wallets .
This is why it is crucial that well before 1 January 2002 , a whole host of measures are taken , so that these are in place when the new coins and notes are introduced .
If , in 15 months &apos; time , the same coins and notes are introduced in 11 Member States , it will be more expensive to get hold of that single currency outside the country in which you live .
When the European currency was first conceived , comments were made which I can not bring myself to repeat . Instead , at the end of 2001 , we shall see coins and bank notes being issued .
However , as always , I must repeat that we often confuse the introduction of notes and coins on 1 January next year with the introduction of the euro which took place on 1 January 1999 , and which has already brought us clear benefits and positive results , as some of you have pointed out .
Lastly , the actual changeover to the euro , with the introduction of coins and notes , is at risk of being hampered by the very people who decided that it would go ahead .
Report on the preparations for the introduction of euro notes and coins
The next item is the Commission communication on the report on preparations for the introduction of euro notes and coins .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the euro has been a reality since 1 January 1999 and the coins and notes will be introduced in 272 days .
It enables us to prevent this being procyclical and to prepare ourselves for the risks posed by the ageing of the population , to speed up our structural reforms in order to improve our growth potential , to make progress in the field of financial legislation in order to further integrate the markets , and to complete the process through the introduction of notes and coins , which we hope will take place successfully on 1 January .
For example , one in every four people ( 25 per cent ) believes that euro notes and coins issued in one country will only be legal currency in that country , which indicates that a factor as fundamental as the existence of the single currency is still not fully understood .
The banks are cooperating well ; they are carrying out changes in advance in their relations with their clients ; the adaptation of automatic cash dispensers in 2002 will probably be very rapid , and even immediate in the majority of Member States ; in general , they will issue notes of low value and will thereby contribute to alleviating the problems of returning change which may arise in commercial operations .
In today &apos; s communication , the Commission offers 20 new practices , 10 to be applied before the introduction of notes and coins on 1 January , and another 10 which could be implemented at a later date .
Or creating and distributing instruments for calculating the cash requirements of small businesses , a fundamental issue when it comes to calling for the front loading of notes and coins .
After the introduction of the notes and coins on 1 January 2002 , other issues of interest may be raised .
We also recommend , for example , that the &apos; neutralisation &apos; of national notes be authorised for some economic operators , so that we can reduce the risks of transport .
Finally , there is a series of ideas which we believe to be useful , which have been applied already in some Member States and which are no doubt going to be have a positive effect in terms of ensuring that this introduction of notes and coins for 300 million Europeans takes place more easily .
The logistical operation is of great importance , and we should try to resolve the majority of the problems before that date arrives so that these possible second level and less important practical problems do not cloud the fundamental issue , that is the introduction of euro notes and coins .
However , it is the case that the coins and notes campaign has still not begun , since most of it will begin in June , and be reinforced in September .
There will be national campaigns , as well as a European Central Bank campaign which will undoubtedly have a specific effect on coins and notes and their technical characteristics , including security characteristics , which will take place as we come closer to the final stage and will give everybody a clearer knowledge of the situation .
Europe is also clever enough to issue notes of EUR 500 .
It is linked to drug smuggling , terrorism and forgery of bank notes .
The advisability of setting up a permanent European Technical and Scientific Centre for the analysis and the classification of counterfeit coins is also referred to and , especially , the need for entities engaged in the daily handling of notes and coins for their clients to carry out suitable checks on the authenticity of these .
Otherwise , it is citizens who are affected , and the latter are completely unprotected when they receive counterfeit coins and notes .
I therefore think it is much more appropriate for notes and coins to be analysed before they leave the exchange entity .
Despite all this , as the euro takes the form of a note or coin , there is obviously the very real risk that there will be attempts to counterfeit it , and as a result , prevention policies are essential .
Therefore , and given that the legislative proposals that we are examining today aim to regulate this matter , it is essential both that we have an effective system of police and customs cooperation and that we establish a global information system that includes identifying counterfeit notes , collecting them and sending them to centres that study the method of counterfeiting , the paper used , the ink , the amount counterfeited , etc .
It is important that they be obliged not only to withdraw from circulation any notes and coins whose authenticity is questionable , but also to check for authenticity themselves .
The most vulnerable , the most fragile , those who are least well - informed , small businesses , micro-businesses who may find themselves bearing the cost of worthless , forged notes that they have accepted by mistake .
We are asking them to give citizens a guarantee that they will be reimbursed if they accept a forged note by mistake , at least during a transitional period .
We must now shoulder the responsibility , in other words , to postpone the changeover to coins and notes until next January - would it matter after everything we have been through ? This would , in any case , be desirable for several other reasons .
The amount of money that can be put into a small suitcase will be roughly ten times larger than it would have been if we had restricted the currency to smaller notes .
It is all very well having something up and running later , but if I was organised crime , the time which I would be trying to engage in counterfeiting on a large scale would be around the period of introduction of the euro when you are going to have four hundred million people in the European Union and billions of people around the world who have never been familiar with the notes themselves .
So I think that there is a threat there and I hope that the Commission and the European Central Bank , although it is probably too late to consider whether to issue a five hundred euro note , will actually consider whether they should issue it at the beginning of the process when there are so many dangers attached to it .
At the moment , they are giving the public neither a financial guarantee against the risk of counterfeit euros , nor financial aid for adaptation measures , as if this were a straightforward operation of replacing one set of notes with another .
We are facing a quite exceptional and hazardous operation , which involves both replacing all coins and notes and at the same time changing all the points of reference .
&quot; Mrs Cederschiöld &apos; s report rightly emphasises the considerable risks of the euro being counterfeited &quot; &quot; when euro notes and coins come into circulation &quot; &quot; and consequently entering the race for the &quot; &quot; title of the world &apos; s most counterfeited currency &quot; &quot; at the time that &quot; &quot; internal frontiers are abolished , thus allowing criminals to move around freely throughout the European Union &quot; &quot; . &quot;
The risk that attempts may be made to counterfeit the euro currency when it begins to circulate in the form of coins and notes is very high .
The euro currency does run a particular risk of being counterfeited at the time when it is introduced into circulation and during the period when it will circulate alongside national notes and coins .
I am referring primarily to the months of January and February of next year when many people will be unfamiliar with the actual make - up of the euro notes and coins .
To illustrate : If you earn $ 100 a week , at payday the money is converted into smaller notes and put in the envelopes , such as food , $ 30 ; housing , $ 20 ; household operation , $ 10 ; personal allowance , $ 20 ; savings , $ 5 , and so forth .

Therefore , we should debate and vote on it tomorrow ; otherwise there is a danger of obstruction by one group .
Put the obstruction of freedom of religion and the gross violations of human rights in China at the top of the agenda .
But we expect cooperation from the Council at long last , not obstruction by finance ministers at conciliation .
We may have a situation where Cyprus does not accede to the European Union due to obstruction on the part of the Turkish Cypriots , who give us reason to believe they will agree later , with the result that we delay Cyprus &apos; s accession to the European Union .
Even where States have issued a standing invitation , special rapporteurs are frequently faced with obstruction and inconvenience in the execution of their mandates .
The reason I must return to Prague , as already stated by Mr Hans - Gert Pöttering , is the unprecedented obstruction from the socialists which we have been confronting throughout the Presidency and about which I have been quite open .
In my opinion , however , you are here as the President - in - Office of the European Council , which is why I fail to understand your comment about obstruction by the social democrats .
The events of the last few days , the opposition and obstruction Minister Pinto has condemned , are a clear expression of the attitude the British intend to bring to this matter .
Who forced the Commission into inefficiency , political weakness , and a policy of concealment and obstruction towards Parliament ?
Hence my question to the Council , but I fear that the Council is not here today , my question is this : when is this obstruction of the ELISE programme going to end ?
Without the obstruction of earth ’ s atmosphere , it can see so well that , theoretically , it s resolving power is “ equivalent to distinguishing a car ’ s left and right headlights from a distance of 2,500 miles &#91; 4,000 km &#93; , ” says the magazine Sky &amp; Telescope .
It &apos; s done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through .
The obstructions which some Member States are creating at the moment do give us the strong impression that some Member States do not want to embrace the European citizenship idea at all .
Let me also draw your attention , at this point , to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters to combat organised crime , tabled by the French Presidency in order to remove the obstructions affecting the work of judges .
According to my personal experience the best way to overcome obstructions to inter-religious harmony and to bring about understanding is through dialogue with members of other faith traditions .
My fellow MEP Mrs Buitenweg has asked questions on this matter . Your Commission should make sure that such obstruction does not occur .
More important was the terror which preceded this , the obstructions put in place by the ruling elite in order to prevent the opposition from meeting , the monopoly of the state channels , the prevention of journalists from doing their job , the obstacles placed in the way of observers , the incidents of torture and the abductions , including even the abduction of important union leaders . The list goes on .
Amendment No 1 is an ELDR Group amendment , which calls for the strengthening of the current inadequate intervention powers of the Commission to clear obstructions to the free movement of goods .
Hence my appeal to the Member States not to raise any new obstructions in respect of enlargement .
Perhaps if she had known at the outset the scale of the obstructions and difficulties , she would not have achieved so much .
Why do we not do it , why can we not just get rid of these obstructions ?
It would accept that the current veto is a tool of obstruction , a privilege that can no longer be justified .
Finally , I should like to hear when the Commission will at long last do as it has repeatedly been asked to do and table proposals for removing obstructions for the free movement of persons for married homosexual couples .
The European Commission and the Council should not linger at the halfway stage , but continue to demolish this obstruction , together with financial and bureaucratic barriers , while maintaining a strong level of protection against criminals and lawbreakers .
Thus , surveillance can not be used in the case of second - degree crimes , and data protection is also often an obstruction .
It is therefore not so much the lack of a political will on the part of the European Union that I see as an obstruction to any effective campaign against high unemployment , but rather the lack of willingness on the part of individual Member States to adjust their economic and social - policy framework conditions to fit those of the international competition .
According to the proposed intervention mechanism , the Commission will ask the Member State in question , by means of a decision , to take the necessary measures to end an obvious , classified and unjustified obstruction to the acceptance of Articles 30 and 36 of the Treaty , seriously hampering the freedom of movement of goods in the internal market .
Parliamentary immunity is intended , and must be used and continue to be used , so that the institution as such can safeguard itself from the obstruction of our duties as a co -legislator in the meantime .
When the obstruction broke loose , or the water found another exit , it was like a flash flood that carried with it millions upon millions of tons of rocks , mud and trees .
Of prime importance is finding a location where there are no obstructions immediately overhead .
It can follow a contour line to stay on the same level , which will make the route longer , or perhaps flow along a tunnel cut through the obstruction .
This had resulted in much obstruction by such type of “ elders ” to the world - wide witness work that the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society was encouraging by its service representative in each congregation .
When this becomes necessary , because of a hazard to health , the flesh that is cut off is viewed as excessive , or as an obstruction , standing in the way of maintaining a clean and healthy condition .
It means a complete removal of anything that is acting as an obstruction , such as pride , causing one to become unresponsive to Jehovah , to his appeals and to his Word .
Decides that any serious obstacle to the freedom of movement of UNOCI and of the French forces which support it , or any attack or obstruction to the action of UNOCI , of the French forces , of the High Representative for the elections and of the International Working Group constitutes a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process for purposes of paragraphs 9 and 11 of resolution 1572 ( 2004 ) ;
Requests the Secretary - General and the French Government to report to it immediately , through the Security Council Committee established by paragraph 14 of resolution 1572 ( 2004 ) ( the Committee ) , of any serious obstacle to the freedom of movement of UNOCI and of the French forces which support it , including the names of those responsible , and requests also the High Representative for the elections and the International Working Group to report to it immediately , through the Committee , any attack or obstruction to their action ;
They &apos; re built on the hills , inland from the beaches in Rio , and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions .
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water , given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land .
A situation which becomes sadder and sadder as the occupations available to those with no qualifications become scarcer and scarcer .
The directive under consideration covers the gamut of salaried employment and independent occupations and professions .
Only racial discrimination is to be prohibited in all areas of society in general . Discrimination for other reasons , for example because of handicap or sexual orientation , is only prohibited when it comes to employment and occupation .
Women are also over -represented in &apos; typically female &apos; occupations but under - represented in jobs with responsibility and in the professions .
Because if you believe that domestic work should be recognised as an occupation in its own right , and Mrs Smet says that , and I echo her sentiments , then what you meet with in the first instance is disbelief and a lack of understanding .
It is also high time that we accorded more status to work in the home and recognised domestic work as a perfectly valid occupation .
It would be to go too far and would also be the wrong route to take . It is inconsistent with the determination to see domestic work as a perfectly valid occupation .
She wants this type of work to be recognised as an occupation in its own right and is calling for European rules to be established on the rights of these workers - at present the situation varies from country to country .
Why should they be in a career which has economic uncertainty when other occupations offer a much more attractive life , much more security , work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. , with week - ends off and with long holidays ?
Yet if we look at freedom of information , we need to go a step further than simply guaranteeing that every journalist can practise his or her occupation without external influence .
The next item is the recommendation by Mr Hughes , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ( A5- 0196 / 2001 ) , for second reading on the Council Common Position for adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive on the organisation of the working time of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road - transport activities &#91; 5919 / 1 / 2001 - C5-0134 / 2001 - 1998 / 0319 ( COD ) &#93; .
Three things are clear : one , women &apos; s wages are on average lower than men &apos; s across all occupations ; two , women are predominantly employed in areas where the work has traditionally been regarded as of less value ; three , women comprise a significantly higher proportion of part - time workers than men .
I would like to point to three difficulties but first of all I want to make one thing clear : when we refer to a 25 % wage gap , this covers all occupations taken together .
Even taking into account the structural differences between men and women in the labour market , such as age , training , occupation and career pattern , women &apos;s pay is still 15 % lower , on average , than that of men , which can only be explained by value discrimination mechanisms .
We closely followed developments regarding this problem and we supported a paragraph put forward by Switzerland , discussing this problem . The text makes references to discrimination based on ancestry and occupation , which clearly describes types of discrimination , the helpless victims of which live in several countries around the world .
I would therefore prefer it if there were no list of these occupations .
Will the Council therefore say whether the deliberations which take place between those Ministers will also cover the following additional data to define more clearly the identity of European citizens and , in more general terms , EU residents : fingerprints , colour of eyes and hair , height , weight , blood group and subgroup , visible scars and other physical distinguishing features , hair growth , disabilities , nationality , place of birth , religion , family status , occupation , and academic qualifications .
Politics is not a dirty business ; it is actually a most enjoyable occupation !
I hope that tomorrow this House will approve the proposal as formulated by the Committee on Regional Policy , and the Socialist Group is , of course , against the amendments tabled by Mr Helmer , which attempt to demolish or weaken a system which I believe has now been precisely calculated to prevent these businesses or occupations from disappearing .
What I want to know is how the Council will address the fact that part of the European Union is under foreign occupation , and whether you have any thoughts on how things will develop in the occupied part of the island .
On the other hand , there is an ever - increasing need for people pursuing occupations in which there are shortages in Europe .
Not just passengers &apos; full names and details of the flight in question , but even all their credit card details , information on other trips they had made , data , for instance , that could lead back to descriptions of passengers &apos; ethnic and religious backgrounds , medical data , addresses of all kinds , their occupation , membership of certain groups , and so forth .
Cement is a major cause of eczema for all workers in occupations involving the regular use of cement .
It can also be assumed that this was harmonised with the new provisions on admission to the occupation , which means that , in this respect too , there are no weak points left .
If it carries on in this way , we had better increase the number of places in this House , since that will be the only occupation left that unqualified people would be allowed to do .
Unfortunately , we need to deal today with the lack of personnel within the European Union , and in particular in France , in all nautical occupations .
At a time when the European economy is stagnating , when unemployment is no longer falling , we need to enhance the status of the various occupations in this sector , in particular for young Europeans , to stimulate the desire to work in this field .
In this way , European businesses would then be able to employ EU nationals working in these nautical occupations .
Mr Posselt , whom I thank for his opinion , regretted that fewer and fewer young people are taking up this wonderful rural occupation of beekeeping .
More relaxed arrangements apply to a whole range of occupations and activities and the reference periods are generous .
During the week of hearty celebrations for the new year , millions of temporary workers return from the cities where they are employed in manual , low - level occupations to their hometown in the countryside , where their family still lives and owns usage rights over a piece of land .
They represent the beloved dead ones , their occupations and hobbies .
Especially would all who engage in sedentary occupations , who are overweight or who are continually plagued with one or more minor ills , do well to heed the counsel of the inspired proverb : “ Put a knife to your throat if you are a man given to appetite . ” — Prov .
Where a person ’ s daily occupation does not give him the needed exercise he should be alert to keep his muscles fit in some other way .
If the strike impact of a given occupation group lacked effect , the leaders would order them to return to work .
Another problem that many persons have , especially those engaged in sedentary occupations , is constipation .
People engaged in sedentary occupations , such as office workers , professors , teachers and lawyers are far more likely to have gallstones than are those engaged in physical labor , such as farmers , bricklayers and carpenters .
Yet , contrary to our urgings , most people just awoke and went about their various occupations .
It should be remembered that , in the book of Ecclesiastes , Solomon was investigating the “ calamitous occupation ” of sinful , dying mankind .
He said : “ I set my heart to seek and explore wisdom in relation to everything that has been done under the heavens — the calamitous occupation that God has given to the sons of mankind in which to be occupied . ”
MANY insects engage in occupations similar to those of humans .
While these scavenger insects help to keep the ground clean , their odorous occupation serves their own interests .
In the first century C.E. , Christians engaged in a variety of secular occupations .
Generally , a chair with a firm cushion and straight back is best for a person with a sedentary occupation .
In particular , certain orthopedists stress the need of exercise , especially for all those engaged in sedentary occupations .
Often one - time athletes who now engage in such an occupation suffer from crippling backaches .
With the American Civil War , cotton growing in Fiji became a profitable occupation .
Growing teen - agers require more food than does the average housewife or other adults who may be engaged in sedentary occupations .
And across the Atlantic , Pulitzer prize winner Arthur Schlesinger , Jr . , observes that America “ is suddenly conscious that the quality of life has actually been in decay for some time ; the streets have grown more dangerous ; the mails and telegraph are worse ; ... household service has become a fading memory ; electricians and plumbers a vanishing occupation .
To avoid having piles , the recommendation is to exercise if yours is a sedentary occupation and to be sure to eat plenty of food that has high residues .
A sedentary occupation also seems to favor the formation of kidney stones .
If yours is a sedentary occupation , make it a point to get more exercise .
Many farmers feel that their occupation brings them close to God . ”
Yet , as I look at Nefer ( that ’ s my cat ’ s name ) I can hardly believe that even she looks upon the attack , capture and storage of rubber bands as a serious occupation .
Some homosexuals seem to have a preference for certain occupations , such as hairdressing , interior decorating , fashion designing and the performing arts .
He was a shepherd . It &apos; s the symbol of his own occupation .
And so it &apos; s anachronistically a classification by fathers &apos; occupations , so single parents go on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe , and no possible occupation except information gathering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
The same goes for the other countries , especially for the Palestinians , who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C , despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements .
We can therefore safely say , for example , that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten , which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people , who always opposed occupation by Indonesia .
Mr President - in - Office of the Council , Commissioner , the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40 % of its territory by Turkey , which has continued for 26 years .
The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status , even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus , for example , by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos , is clearly encouraging Turkey &apos; s intransigence .
It is not self - evident given their history of illegal occupation and deportation and the politically motivated transfer of people into their countries , accompanied by the suppression of every expression of national self - determination up to the end of the 1980s .
For two centuries France &apos; s Mediterranean policy consisted of the colonisation of Morocco , Tunisia and Algeria . Italy &apos; s was the occupation of Libya , and Britain &apos; s the shameless looting of Egypt .
Neither will the occupation of the land of white farmers resolve the problems .
The worst thing of all was the aggression during the time of the Nazi and Fascist occupation .
Yet the fact that the joint motion for a resolution calls for law and order to be enforced and condemns &apos; the illegal occupations &apos; and accompanying violence is pure hypocrisy .
We might have more faith in the sincerity of the authors of this motion in &apos; deploring the recent murders , beatings and intimidation associated with the ... occupation &apos; if they at least deigned to recall the past massacres in which a handful of colonists dispossessed the indigenous population of its land and the decades of colonial violence and apartheid used to preserve this situation .
&quot; Having said that , I am not questioning the role of the KFOR , the role of the United Nations in Kosovo , at all , but we can not consider and plan an &quot; &quot; occupation &quot; &quot; of Kosovo for many years without running serious risks . &quot;
With regard to this issue , the Head of State has allowed a huge movement for the occupation of properties to develop and has halted the legal framework for future compulsory purchases .
Mr President , I welcomed the Minister &apos; s reply but I would like him to give an assurance to this House that he and the Council will not lose sight in their consideration of this problem of the 604 Kuwaiti citizens who disappeared as a result of the illegal occupation of Kuwait by Iraq and that they will keep pressing the Iraqi authorities for an explanation of the fate of these people .
The Council refers constantly to the Cyprus problem , but what we are talking about here is the occupation of 40 % of the territory of an independent Member State of the UN and candidate for accession to the European Union , which is being left to the mercy of a powerful occupying force .
Madam President , 50 years on we have been celebrating over the last few years the end of the war , the founding of the United Nations , the founding of the World Health Organisation , the return of independence to the Baltic Nations from the Soviet Empire , but sadly also 50 years on we have to commemorate China &apos; s illegal occupation of Tibet : fifty years of suppression and oppression of the Tibetan people by the Chinese regime .
In particular we must ask Iraq to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross on tracing the 604 Kuwaiti citizens who disappeared as a result of the illegal Iraqi occupation of Kuwait .
Israel &apos; s withdrawal from southern Lebanon on 24 May of this year put an end to 22 years of occupation and , as a result , &apos; re -dealt the cards &apos; , as it were .
The situation in southern Lebanon can only be stabilised if this region , which has suffered enormously from the occupation and the war , is rehabilitated and reintegrated into Lebanon &apos; s economic and social fabric .
There were arrests recently during events for world peace day on 1 September , Cyprus continues to be occupied and , as we are preparing to release funds , Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit has said that the Cyprus question was resolved in 1974 , i.e. with the barbaric invasion and continuing occupation , demonstrating his disdain for UN resolutions .
This makes it easier to understand why the European Union is not troubled by the barbaric invasion and continued occupation of 38 % of Cyprus and by Turkey &apos; s bombing raids in Iraq .
We do not agree with Recital A where it says that Europe was divided by the Soviet occupation because , as everybody knows and as any history book will tell you , the division was a consequence of the Yalta Conference and the intransigence of Truman who was determined to follow a policy of confrontation .
If Europe is to embrace this historic opportunity for enlargement , removing the divisions created by the Soviet occupation and the communist experiment , candidate countries must be given a chance to accede within a reasonable timeframe .
Some of them , a short while ago oppressed by Communism and subjugated by the Soviet empire , or still divided by military occupation like Cyprus , also see it as a guarantee of independence and security .
The vast majority of these people are there as a result of a decade of occupation , which is why they keep themselves very much to themselves .
The right of the State of Israel to exist and to security is very important to us , as are the Israelis themselves who , together with the Palestinians , are currently demonstrating that they have had enough of occupation and enough of this violence .
The fact that an electoral college of 800 members subsequently decided on the occupation of six seats and the fact that only 175 000 businesspeople were entitled to elect the other half of parliament turned the elections into a complete farce .
Like Mrs Maes , we are perplexed at the paradoxical behaviour , in which we see how , since the creation of the European Union , millions of euros of aid have been approved for countries that are clearly involved in the military occupation of one or other of their neighbours .
If we do not tackle very soon the issue of the recognition of a Palestinian State , a State which can coexist with Israel , if military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip does not cease , the issue can not be resolved . It must be resolved , first and foremost , of course , in order to put an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people , but also in order to bring more stability to the region .
It is the specific problem of the invasion and occupation of a significant part of the territory of a country which is a member of the UN and a candidate for membership of the European Union by another country which is also a member of the UN and also a candidate for membership of the European Union .
Are we are saying that the Cyprus question can be resolved without ending the occupation ?
We also call for an end to 40 years of Israeli occupation in the interests of peace and justice for all .
With May 15th fast approaching - and with it the 60th Anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba - a wonderful initiative dubbed ‘ Blog About Palestine Day ’ will take place encouraging sites and bloggers to write something , anything having to do with Palestine and the Occupation .

We therefore have another duty at international level , which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade : the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries , not just in terms of writing off debts , but also via the unilateral opening - up to trade with the poorest countries in the world , with a great deal of willingness on our part , which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice .
The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques , given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime .
In our opinion , the main criticism of this proposal for a Commission regulation relates to the opening up of a budget line to non-agricultural organisations and also the reduction in budget appropriations to EUR 4 500 000 .
Studies show that two thirds of Tunisian industry would not survive the opening of frontiers .
With regard to the information society , the principle elements of the e-Europe initiative proposed by the Commission were put into effect , in particular regarding the legal framework for e-commerce , the opening of the telecommunications market , internet connections for schools and teacher training .
The opening up of financial markets should , naturally , go hand in hand with an adequate level of consumer protection , and this was also requested this evening in this debate .
I hope , even if the omens for this Intergovernmental Conference are not the best , that there may still be an opening here or there .
The opening up of the markets means that the sector has evolved in very diverse ways .
It is something that is fully accepted and we now need to translate that and move that forward as quickly as possible , towards further deregulation and even quicker opening of those markets that still work imperfectly .
The report we now have to discuss is a giant step forward in the gradual opening up of the Finnish markets .
As a counterbalance to the opening up to EU imports , Finland , however , is asking for the right to reduce quotas on beer imported from non-member countries .
They range from reductions in customs tariffs , from starting rates of often over 40 % to an average of 10 % , to the opening of import and export monopolies via joint ventures in the service sector , trade chains and medium - term freedom of establishment for independent European undertakings .
Will it mark the beginning of a further opening of society ?
And , of course , will there also be a further opening of the market ?
We must have an active policy in order to contribute towards resolving the dramatic problem of the Palestinian refugees , and we can actively offer ideas and resources in order to ensure that the Middle East peace process will make decisive progress , which would also lead to a greater opening up and intensification of the Euro - Mediterranean process .
A parallel development could create new political openings and constitute progress , because the various interests would be directly dependent upon one another .
Those which delayed were wrong , especially those which at the same time took advantage of the opening of markets elsewhere and we have evidence that this also applies to countries outside the European Union .
The opening up of the market will lead to reorganisation on a European scale with common rules for all the countries .
These may be public or private , nobody is questioning that , but it is obvious that , if we integrate the network , this automatically leads to an opening up of our market .
The stated political aim of these programmes is to encourage the opening up of these countries &apos; markets to European capital .
There is no genuine opening for competition and , most importantly , provision is continuing to be made to subsidise the cinema industry without taking into account what it produces .
Clearly , the opening up to risk capital will require scrupulous behaviour on the part of managers so as to minimise any possible risks .

The progress made on the internal market , the gradual growth in trade due to the increasing opening up of the markets and the progress of the information society mean that the Community Customs Code needs to be brought up to date with the development of Community and international trade .
We should therefore remain level - headed and focused in our attempts to create openings for a development which will bring Serbia nearer to Europe , also from a moral - political point of view .
Examples include the European company , the pan- European liberalisation and privatisation of the postal services , which is stumbling along , the opening - up of competition in the energy sector or the commencement of the harmonisation of taxation .
The first one was fair pricing and the second was the provision of a universal service in the context of the further opening of the communications market to competition .

The opening of frontiers for the single market was a thoroughly good idea but it has also helped the Mafia , and criminals from Eastern Europe to spread their tentacles across our Union .
Madam President , the opinion of the committee of which I have the honour to be draftsman , which was approved by a very large majority , introduces limitations to the rapid liberalisation of the postal services , opting for a gradual and controlled opening to competition without market distortions which would be detrimental to the services &apos; customers and users and to the national universal service companies .
Thus , we propose that the opening should take into account Article 16 of the Treaty , which raises the provision of traditional postal services to the category of services of general interest , given the place they occupy in the shared values of the Union and their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion , for which reason they should operate on the basis of principles and conditions that enable them to fulfil their missions .
Without jeopardising the modernisation of all postal services and the opening to competition , Member States must continue to preserve their rural network of counter services , which help bring the remote places closer to centres of decision making and are thus indispensable to the social cohesion of the smallest urban or rural communities .
The opening up of postal services to greater competition is one of the recommendations of the Transport Committee .
I say this in all sincerity , for we Italian radicals feel , on the contrary , that the Commission &apos; s proposal , put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein , makes complete sense and that it would bring about both gradual opening - up of the market to competition and , in any case , the establishing of fixed time frames for all operators . This proposal could not be considered to be as laissez - faire as some say it is .
Madam President , the Postal Services Directive of 1997 provided for a gradual and controlled opening of postal markets to private providers .
It is therefore desirable that Parliament should not subscribe to the battering - ram strategy proposed by the Commission and should adhere to the strategy of controlled and gradual opening of the postal markets .
If according to them , the time is still not ripe for further opening , surely we should be able to make the necessary preparations so that the market can be further opened up ?
He said that between now and the end of the decade the opening to competition of virtually the whole postal market appears to be inevitable .
&quot; After all , we had put out a statement on 28 October which calls on Mr Laurent Gbagbo &quot; &quot; to bring about the opening up of democracy for which the citizens of Côte d &apos; Ivoire are clamouring &quot; &quot; . &quot;
Respect , for example , for human rights ; non-proliferation issues ; access for the population to external aid ; better operating conditions for NGOs - a point I was able to make to the DPRK Foreign Minister in Bangkok last summer - and the opening up of the DPRK &apos; s economy and the structural reform that will be a necessary part of that .
In particular , we must reconcile the major opening up of the European market , importing 60 % of consumption , with the need to protect our fishermen , who see the Japanese , American and Korean markets closing .
The Council also notes the recent relatively positive development thanks to the endeavours made by the United Nations Secretary - General &apos; s Special Envoy for Burma , Tan Sri Razali Ismail , and the opening of a channel for dialogue between Aung San Sui Kyi and the military junta .
So these are the two crucial components : the opening - up of all networks for cross-border traffic and the establishment of an independent regulatory authority in all Member States , so as to guarantee fair competition .
Setting a deadline of 2003 for the opening - up of the trans - European rail freight network certainly sounds reasonably committed , as does a deadline of 2008 for national freight traffic , but this is surely sending out the wrong signals .
He observes that little progress has been made by the Member States in implementing the separation of the rail service operations from those of infrastructure management and we do not see in most countries any effective opening - up of the rail market .
Although opening up of the roads was easy , because discontinuities could be eliminated instantly , the opening up of the railway is still coming up against a whole raft of technical obstacles .
These fears can only be compounded when just last week in Mallaig , with the opening of the scallop beds , a dramatic increase in boats could be witnessed , which would otherwise have been fishing for the banned species .
Then as the mantle contracts , the opening is sealed and the water is forced out under high pressure through a funnellike passage underneath the head .
The hairs rest in tiny openings alongside which are from two to five oil glands that lubricate the skin as well as keep it soft and smooth and serve to protect it .
When the cold is very severe , it is also wise to protect the mouth and nose with a shawl , or a face mask that has openings for the eyes and nose .
When blood is forced through an unusually small opening , substances in the blood are triggered to form a clot or thrombus .

The actual breakthrough came on December 1 after the remaining yards of chalk were chipped out to create a man - sized opening that allowed workers from both sides to meet and shake hands .
That shattering , that opening of my girl cell , that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous , and braver , and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life .
And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
There are some optimistic answers to this question , so some people will bring up the Age of Exploration and the opening up of the world .
Madam President , my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part - session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.
We too are concerned about this lack of democracy , and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the &apos; Dialogue on Europe &apos; in order to play it s part in this direct contact with the people . This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference .
Michel Camdessus , a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund , said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference , and I am now quoting , that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other .
The fight against fraud and corruption should be made a condition for allocating debt relief and development aid - not my words , Mr President , but the words of President Obasanjo of Nigeria in Abuja at the opening of the 13th session of the ACP - EU Assembly .
The action programme against discrimination , the Commission &apos; s two proposals for directives , the opening of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia , and lastly the adoption of Article 13 of the Treaty all give an irrevocable signal .
I was there when she gave her speech in Vienna to mark the opening of the Observatory .
The communication updates the list of priorities for the opening of new delegations and offices .
Finally , we shall be convening the European Conference twice , once in Sochaux on 23 November for the ministers of European affairs of the Fifteen and ministers from the candidate countries , and once in Nice on 7 December for the Heads of State and Government , at the opening of the Biarritz Summit .
No one can forget the testimony of Judge Edwin Cameron , a white , homosexual , HIV positive man on the bench of the South African High Court . He courageously came forward at the opening of the plenary session of the International AIDS Conference in Durban last July .
I believe that the proposed opening of on additional facility for raw materials that have access to inward processing arrangements will not be sufficient to cover the food industry supply and export requirements .
The voting session will be long and will be interrupted , amongst other things , by the welcome presence of President Kostunica . In addition , some of us will have to leave in order to be present at the opening of the Marseilles Conference , and so we would like to be able to vote on the oral question at the start of the session before all the other reports .
It reacted immediately to the new order in Croatia , by undertaking the process that will lead , at the Zagreb summit on 24 November , in other words in ten days &apos; time , to the opening of negotiations aimed at concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with this country .
Commissioner , you say that you are going to adopt the necessary measures , one of which is the opening of an infringement procedure .
Mr Joseph Kabila must demand and must clearly announce a timetable for the opening of internal Congolese dialogue and the organisation of free elections .
The opening and progress of negotiations between your country and the European Union demonstrate , and I am particularly pleased to see this , that Slovakia has fully mastered the &apos; catching up &apos; principle , because it was at the request of the European Parliament that this principle was established at the Helsinki European Council .
As regards the modalities of establishing diplomatic relations , this will soon be discussed with the North Koreans and I understand that no decision has yet been taken on the opening of a delegation , where it should be and how it should be done .
I greatly regret the fact that my only opportunity to put a question to you regarding the Dell &apos; Utri case is at the opening of Parliament during the discussion of the agenda .
The opening of infringement proceedings against Italy is also being considered .
I think that the recent events there are , sadly , even further justification for the opening of such a delegation .
Commissioner , with a view to achieving the greatest transparency and clarity in the opening of these proceedings , I would like you to tell us whether you have opened them simply as a result of these innocent questions - because they really were innocent questions seeking information - or whether there are really sufficient reasons , because it contravenes Community directives for a regional government to subsidise what it must not subsidise and in the least appropriate way .
Perhaps you also recall that I said this at the opening of the exceptional sitting that was held on the Wednesday , the day after the events .
Thank you , Mrs McKenna , for having added to what I said at the opening of the sitting .
Mr President , two weeks ago , I was in the Netherlands on &apos; Prince &apos; s Day &apos; , the opening of the new parliamentary year , when the government budget is presented .
Madam President , I believe you have been told about the discussion which took place in the House this morning at the opening of the sitting .
This is so true that even an apparently harmless issue such as the opening of delegations in Bakou and Armenia has not yet been resolved by the Commission .
We have to be there for the opening of the Stability Pact conference tomorrow , which , and it is not entirely irrelevant to what the honourable Member says in his report , at least indicates a measure of success over the last couple of years for the evolving common , foreign and security policy .
. ( FR ) We have voted against the joint resolution submitted by the European People &apos; s Party and Socialist Groups on the forthcoming ministerial conference of the WTO in Qatar in November , as it seems to us that it is yet again trapping us by agreeing to the opening of new international trade negotiations without adequate clarification of what the ground rules are and what objectives are in view .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel is a European event , a happy European event , just as the accident in the St. Gotthard Tunnel is a tragic , sad European event .
What contingency plans has the Council considered to respond to the threat of attack by terrorists on nuclear installations in the EU , and , in particular , on the Sellafield plant , taking into account the totally unacceptable decision of the British Environment Secretary to give the go - ahead on 3 October 2001 for the opening of the MOX ( mixed oxide ) plant at Sellafield , formal approval of which had been delayed because of the falsification of records by BNFL ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you will recall , in the last Strasbourg week we had actually planned to have a debate to celebrate the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel .
We all have to give way somewhere - the USA on hormonally treated meat , the labelling of genetically modified produce and the opening up of the textiles market .
There are only six more months to the opening of the World Cup .
The opening of common consulates will be a first step and I hope that we will go further .
At the risk of creating further offence to you , I have to admit that I attended the opening of the exhibition and was proud to do so .
I see Turkey &apos; s consent to the opening of an Amnesty International office as a favourable indication .
From this point of view , I refer to what I said at the opening of today &apos; s sitting on the incredible revelation in the New York Times regarding the existence of a secret plan at the Pentagon to authorise the use of atomic weapons .
It also formalised , first the opening of this new structure within the EIB and , secondly , the fact that a year after the project &apos; s launch , the possibility of opening an independent subsidiary of this European Investment Bank especially dedicated to Euro - Mediterranean financing will be considered .
Now there are many who say that the opening of negotiations of course means that everything can be monitored much better .
The symbolic gesture of their representatives being present at the opening of the latest cultural event held in Indonesia with the support of the Portuguese Embassy did not go unnoticed .
I would also like to remind you of an invitation to the opening of an exhibition about the history of the European Parliament and European integration .
We have nothing against the EU providing technical assistance with assessing the impact of the establishment of free trade and economic regions in Africa , but we vigorously oppose the opening of negotiations being made dependent on this , which could lead to reform of relations between the EU and the ACP States being blocked for a long time .
So , ladies and gentlemen , how should we interpret this debate , which is being held after the opening of the Conference , if not as a sign of political and psychological immaturity in the face of the reality of the threats to our world posed by the upheaval of climate change ?
In terms of Cyprus , I would like a clear statement that neither the Commission nor the Council intends to set a date for the opening of negotiations .
Instead of directly or indirectly setting an opening date for accession negotiations that would have no meaning , we should clearly place our relations with Turkey within the framework of a Euro - Mediterranean partnership which would be given true political substance , instead of simply being shunted onto a free trade platform .
There would be no stronger way of expressing support for Turkey &apos; s reformers than offering a schedule for the opening of the accession negotiations but only on the condition that the Turkish Cypriots were brought to accept the Annan proposals for a federated settlement of the problem of Cyprus .
Mr President , we feel that this debate on the opening of WTO negotiations to liberalise trade in services is extremely patchy .
Only recently at the opening of an exhibition in Brussels by the ambassador of one of the Arab countries , he availed himself of the opportunity to tell me how difficult things were for him and his colleagues .
I see the arrests made in recent weeks as a thank you for our support for Cuba &apos; s entry into the ACP , a thank you for Commissioner Nielson &apos; s visit two or three weeks ago and for the opening of a Commission office in Cuba .
. President Pat Cox at the opening of today &apos; s session indicated that MEPs obliged to depart for Brussels on Convention business might lodge a statement of their position on the Member &apos; s Statute despite their necessary absence from the vote .
With this in mind , I undertake to return here to address you after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the day after the December European Council , so that we can review together what has been achieved .
We shall be using the time between now and about 15 October to contact the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of all the other 24 European Union Member States so that , at the opening of the Conference , we can already present some possible solutions on which everyone can agree .
In addition , its planners believe that the dartlike edifice will become a major tourist attraction , a “ people tower , ” after its opening , scheduled now for early in 1976 .

Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark , in his presidential address at the opening in Norwich of the 123rd annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science . ”
After Daniel tells of the opening of the divine court in heaven and the execution of God ’ s judgment upon the four symbolic beasts , he says : “ I beheld therefore in the vision of the night , and lo , one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven , and he came even to the Ancient of days : and they presented him before him .
The year before the school ’ s opening , he pointed out , there were only 106,000 Kingdom preachers throughout the world , but now there are well over one million proclaiming the good news in 194 countries !
The opening of the assembly was just days away , with delegates on their way from all over Nicaragua , not to speak of the many foreign delegates .
It has been a privilege to live through the turbulent era of persecution in the forties ; to have seen the heyday of radio broadcasting of the Kingdom message ; to be here when divine education received a great impetus , resulting in the opening of Gilead School for missionary training and the Kingdom Ministry School for the advancement of congregation organization .
In the first year of Belshazzar , king of Babylon , what visions did Daniel have , and how did he describe the opening of Court in heaven ?
( a ) Who is the Ancient of Days , and when does this vision of the opening of Court in heaven have its fulfillment ?
At 7 : 30 that evening , the Assembly Hall was packed with 1,518 excited Witnesses eager to share in the official opening of this new school .

With an inspirational leader , I think this year , the opening of the tallest tower in the world is like adding a finger to that hand , that points at all those who spread fallacious stories about us .
Cut to 40 - some - odd years later , we go to Kenya , and we &apos; re walking , we arrive at the opening of this house -- and Agnes hadn &apos;t let me come to the house for days because they were preparing this whole ritual .
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators .
Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications , with the objective always being to guarantee a high - quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs .
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators .
This will allow for meaningful bench - marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators , competitors and customers .
We can see in the incumbent operators , in public post offices , a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers &apos; needs continues .
Mr Medina Ortega , I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation , because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise , through unchecked concentration , to private operators .
Although the common position places firm controls on permitted emissions from waste incinerators , I know that whenever proposals to build such an incinerator are made in my country , people rise in protest , they distrust the operator &apos; s claims and I have a degree of sympathy with them .
In Ireland , some operators are proposing using it in building materials .
This harmonised framework could include common reference points for measuring the operational noise levels to be limited or prohibited , a provision allowing operators sufficient time to come into line with the new operational restrictions and the establishment of a right for people living near airports to request consultation and negotiations on noise reduction objectives .
Clearly , if private operators are involved in the financing , they will aim for maximum profit .
In order to arrive at these results , the directive harmonises certain areas , in particular - to name the main ones - the place where the operators are established , their obligations in terms of transparency , the requirements for transparency in commercial communications , the conditions required for the conclusion and validity of electronic contracts , the responsibility of Internet intermediaries , the settlement of disputes , as well as the competences of national authorities .
Furthermore , operators established in Member States other than the countries concerned should not be allowed to undermine these schemes when selling to an end consumer .
Secondly , a distinction needs to be drawn between the national operator and whoever owns the track .
As far as Euratom nuclear material safeguards are concerned , checks of the diameter of pellets are not covered since operators &apos; declarations for safeguards are based on pellet weights and not on a diameter measurement .
It will bring together nuclear power plant operators and nuclear regulators from both Member States and applicant states .
In reply to Mrs Banotti &apos; s question , this European Nuclear Installation &apos; s safety group brings together the power plant operators and nuclear regulators from both Member States and applicant states .
However , we wish today to offer vigorous support to the Commission &apos; s recommendation that dominant network operators should be responsible for permitting combined services all the way to the subscribers .
Even there , consideration might be given to going further by introducing a situation in which dominant operators become responsible for hiring out the telecommunications companies &apos; premises for the purpose of housing equipment .
In future , it is incumbent on the Commission to ensure more vigorously than ever that the &apos; roaming &apos; fees charged to users by operators are brought down in all EU countries to a sensible level based on actual costs .
At the same time , the Commission must ensure that the fees collected from the operators remain under control .
The costs to the operator might become unreasonably high , should the new generation mobile spectrum be auctioned .
Auctioning may also distort competition , if operators start making &apos; tactical &apos; bids for the spectrum in order to harm the position of their competitors at auction .
Therefore &apos; beauty contests &apos; between the various operators are clearly more consumer - friendly alternatives .
Unlike spectrum auctions , beauty contests do not involve operators having to pay a sum of money that is in the nature of a PAYE tax .
A well - defined auction with well - informed bidders ensures that licences are awarded to operators that can generate greatest economic benefit .
It will be important in applying common competition legislation , however , that the legal provisions relating to a dominant market position are interpreted in a way that does not discriminate against operators in smaller markets .
In this respect , I welcome the fact that the report pays attention to the need to ensure that number portability is not impeded by technical measures or other arrangements which limit consumers &apos; choice of operators and service providers .
Otherwise the European economy will suffer severe losses and European consumers , too , will lose the possibilities that new technology can give them if applied in the proper legal framework which guarantees full competition between operators .
Indeed , the victims are becoming aware that the principle of &apos; polluter pays &apos; is still not truly recognised and that the compensation system set up in 1992 is extremely unsatisfactory and even , bizarrely , lets the vessel operator off scot - free .
China has such huge potential in this market for growth , and European operators have a great opportunity as world leaders looking for new markets .
This is vital if we want to breathe new life into the transport of goods . In this way , new operators are attracted who bring with them new insights and a new management culture .
Amendments Nos 6 , 8 , 9 and 11 , which propose the separation of the operators of infrastructures from the providers of services , clarify the text enormously .
This directive obliges operators of establishments having dangerous substances within certain threshold limits to establish a major accident prevention policy .
We share the rapporteur &apos; s opinion that air transport must be seen as a coherent system of operators , airports and air traffic control services , the component parts of which are directly interlinked and that only a study of this system as a whole will solve the problems of airspace capacity .
The report proposes to introduce competition among air traffic control centres , taking away the link between regulatory authorities and operators .
Lastly , we must guarantee multiplicity and pluralism of bids and provide all operators with the possibility of playing an innovative and leading role , thus liberalising access to public financing .
If we want to maintain a public service , the television broadcasting right must be auctioned off between all the operators : programmes will then be more efficient and there will be a saving for license payers .
Firstly , we must safeguard the future of the dual system of public and private television , and it is essential that European public operators can make full use of the possibilities offered by the new information technologies .
Mr O &apos; Toole is right in saying that simulcasts would not make it possible to attract a group of substantial users and he therefore believes that a trial period for new audiovisual products on channels made available through digital transmission , possibly only over sections of territory , will enable operators and users to achieve the same objective .
The national and European political authorities must therefore impose public service constraints on all these operators , whatever their origin , for example :
As I see it , such an amendment would , in fact , render useless any provision in the field of consumer contracts , notably Article 15 itself . Apart from this , unless I am mistaken , this would leave consumers in a worse situation than that of an operator who is bound by a business - to - business contract , and who would be able to choose between having the case heard in a court in the defendant &apos; s state of domicile and a court in the place where the contract was concluded .
We propose that this should wait until six months after its publication , not only so as to enable operators to become fully conversant with the regulation , but also so as to enable the work that is currently under way on alternative means for dispute resolution to be concluded .
These action thresholds will act as early warning tools , alerting competent authorities and operators so that they actively prevent further contamination of the feed chain by identifying sources of contamination and measures to avoid repetition in the future .
It is the duty of Member States to make sure that the owners and operators of ferries are aware of their responsibilities for the safe passage of people and goods .
At the same time , by ensuring that access to the local loop - the last mile of so - called copper wire - is now open to all new market entrants and is not the exclusive province of the so - called incumbent operators , the regulation will act as a significant boost for increased choice of non-voice services for consumers .
I believe that the national regulatory authority should be able to play a fair and mediating role between existing operators and new networks .
In the case of Italy , but also other European countries , this is probably due to the powerful position of the incumbent operator , which is trying to put off the move for as long as possible .
My only comment , when looking at the slightly loose wording on some of the timing - for example , that notified operators shall from 31 December meet reasonable requests from beneficiaries - is to ask the Commissioner to assure us that he will be very severe in monitoring this , because there is no point in pushing this text through here if we have very slack and loose implementation in the Member States where this also needs to be pushed through .
If it is not financially viable to invest in less populated and less developed areas , it is unlikely to be attractive to new operators .
The proposal that we have will oblige Eirecom , a private limited company , a former state monopoly , to open up its local loop to alternative providers and will not oblige alternative providers already in the market place such as cable TV , satellite and wireless local loop operators to do the same .
Secondly , to ensure transparency by other operators we will have to publish a reference offer for the access conditions to the local loop and associated facilities such as co-location , including pricing , under the scrutiny of the national regulatory authority in order to ensure fairness .
What &apos; unbundled access to the local loop &apos; actually does is force public operators to put the leasing of public telephone lines out to commercial tender as soon as possible .
That is why I welcome these standards for co-incineration of municipal waste and the transportation of waste , which should help bring an end to the present trade in waste where areas with the cheapest operators and the lowest standards become the co-incineration capitals of Europe .
Greater openness is obviously of major concern to people who live near these incinerators , but it will also help to ensure that the plant operators themselves keep below the emission ceilings that have been set .
We prefer our proposal where the flag criterion is linked to the detention record of a ship so as to give a clear and strong signal to sub-standard operators .
This will mean removing the definition of special services which , paradoxically , would prevent the operator of the reserved area from upgrading its services .
Fifthly , no step in the year 2003 , which is contrary to Article 7 of the current directive , and sixthly , no timetable for further reform , which goes against the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit and the needs of the operators themselves .
Operators should have the responsibility for training , but this should be done on a harmonised basis , with a distinct , uniform , European - wide certification system which would be accepted by all Member States .
There is no doubt in my mind that in most cases the operators are best qualified to organise training .
Of course , the Commission hopes that the negotiators representing the operators and the crews will be successful , and Mr Simpson has urged them to reach a voluntary agreement on safety systems relating to flight and duty times and rest periods .
Where the marginal cost charges are concerned , I also think this is a good conciliation . In this way , it will be possible even for long - distance operators to compete .
Firstly , those responsible for managing the infrastructure and charged with ensuring good use of the latter must be completely separate from and independent of service operators and users . Secondly , the railways must be integrated with other forms of transport to achieve a genuine door to door service .
What we are concerned with today is opening up a trans - European network and a trans - European railway to competition , and ensuring that properly licensed European operators may be either public or private .
Apart from this , if there is a voyage data recorder on board a ship , then it is the responsibility of the port State control to inspect it and not that of the terminal operator .
In the knowledge that a captain , together with the terminal operator , has to make a loading and unloading plan which must be put into effect and also monitored , we concur with the consideration not to include the so - called voyage data recorder in this amendment .
I must say that some of the major users and some operators who intend to use and benefit from the possibilities offered by this trans - European rail network have recently indicated to the services of the Commission a large number of technical or operative obstacles which hinder the organisation of international goods services .
Specifically , before the adoption of the technical requirements on interoperability , consultations will be held to ascertain the opinions of the various users and parties involved , including infrastructure managers , operators , rail companies etc. and also the transport and user organisations and others .
The current text of Article 5 ( 1 ) together with the interpretative guidance provided in recital 33 ensures - in the Commission &apos; s opinion - a satisfactory balance between the rights of rightholders and the legitimate interests of other parties involved such as telecom operators , users , consumers and other parties .
The rapporteur - to whom I offer my heartfelt thanks - has forged a compromise which seeks to share responsibility for access between bus manufacturers , operators , local planning and transport authorities .
As well as the institutions , the various parties involved such as bus and coach manufacturers , public transport operators and user groups , including those which represent passengers with reduced mobility , have also arrived at a consensus .
The achievement of a high degree of competitiveness is the precondition for reducing the role played by the regulation so as to enable it s place to be taken by competition law alone , or , conversely , for subjecting operators that have been notified as having significant market power to regulatory obligations and subsequent cost orientation negotiations .
The first remark to be made regards the arrangements for imposing obligations on operators notified as having significant market power .
In fact , notification does not automatically entail any obligations but the national regulatory authorities have to specify the obligations to be imposed on each operator that has been notified .
However , the fact that an operator has significant market power does not always mean that it is misusing that power .
A significant market player is now also one that has the continued ability to limit other operators &apos; contacts with users .
This causes problems , especially for operators offering cross-border telecommunications services , and means that , at present , a business in the telecommunications sector can only start trading once an authority has so decided , i.e. once an individual licence has been issued .
I should like to address a problem which currently hits operators hard in practice .
They often need consent from hundreds of property owners before they can start trading as operators .
This would at least give operators an overview of the legal situation , thereby saving a great deal of time when applying for rights of way .
All the Members of this House have criticised the problems of allocating radio frequencies , the extreme variations in licence costs , the excessive debts of some of the operators , and so there may be risks of the telephone market crashing just as the property market crashed a while back .
There must be further wide - ranging discussion with regard to the position of virtual operators .
We have to consider upon what terms and conditions a virtual operator can work in the network , to permit free competition and to guarantee a benefit to consumers , though , on the other hand , the rights of network ownership should be protected .
This legislation will ensure a level playing field for operators across the single market .
I opposed this because I believed it made more sense to have a single public aerial , network , channel and trench along which all the telecommunications services provided by private operators could be channelled . Similarly , buses and lorries belonging to different companies all travel along the same motorway .
Therefore , I expressly welcome Mr Brunetta &apos; s report , which proposes reasonable obligations for the operator and stresses that prior regulations should be repealed as soon as the aims pursued have been achieved via market mechanisms .
The meagre resources , controlled by one or a few of the operators , for example the local access network in telecommunications , are currently yet another obstruction to competition .
This should apply irrespective of the legal form of the infrastructure operator .
I believe that to be of crucial importance , certainly in cases where operators are in dire financial straits , as many currently are .
If there is one thing which has promoted , and has to promote , competition among operators , it is , of course , the possibility of number portability , and I would make an urgent appeal to our fellow MEPs not to adopt that amendment under any circumstances .
And it is precisely because we have threatened legislation that operators are now prepared to drop their prices , and that is , I believe , what this is ultimately all about .
The move has triggered hot discussion among netizens and some found it unbelievable or said that the channel operators had fallen asleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Websites attract striking writers : operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com could benefit from labor disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
So , in your village , there &apos; s one person in the village with a phone , and that &apos; s the phone kiosk operator .
At the age of twenty I married a signal officer whom I met when I was learning to become a telephone switchboard operator in Puerto Rico .
Could you imagine the task of a telephone operator in such a network ?
This vital function , however , is not handled by a telephone operator .
“ I can ’ t even go to the bathroom without being watched , ” complained one telephone operator .

Finally , I would just like to ask you for clarification on the third part of our question : what do you think of the idea that the Commission could launch a working group in order to have a discussion between Europeans of the tricky notion , which pollutes many of the judgments , that of the interests of the child , which we have included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
Because we are a polyglot , multilingual union , there must be speedy , clear and accurate translation of the courts &apos; judgments into all the languages of the European Union in order that citizens and their legal advisers throughout the European Union are up - to -date on the law of this Union and how it is properly interpreted .

Like the European Commission , the report interprets this ruling as granting the authority to introduce criminal provisions in all Community policies containing binding rules , in order to ensure that they are applied .

Judges are currently asked to enforce the judgments and orders of courts in other Member States without examining the facts , and they will be subject to increasing criticism and public unease if there is no EU- wide compliance with minimal procedural safeguards and defence rights for criminal investigations and prosecutions .

&quot; Companies clearly have many responsibilities but their primary responsibility is to survive as an employer and to take the necessary steps in order to do that - and I do not believe it is for us in this House to lecture them on the best way to do it or to comment upon whether that restructuring is &quot; &quot; intelligent &quot; &quot; or not . &quot;
&quot; As for the development of enforcement procedures - the enforcement orders or &quot; &quot; exequatur &quot; &quot; for foreign judgements - this is no doubt useful in civil cases , such as divorce or custody cases , just as they are useful in some aspects of mutual assistance in legal matters , but care must be taken not to go too far along this route . &quot;

&quot; We need to prescribe conditions for the use of the &quot; &quot; Origin : EU &quot; &quot; label . &quot;
&quot; This approach has the added advantage that the &quot; &quot; Origin : EU &quot; &quot; label has a positive ring to it . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Origin : EU &quot; &quot; is then a symbol for quality and I therefore advocate backing Amendments Nos 60 and 61 . &quot;

What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; What is life ? What is the origin of life ? &quot;

And I think it &apos; s not an accident that you don &apos;t find this idea in the very origin of Islam .
It looked the same , but it had a different origin , it was a different artwork .
I &apos; m a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much ?
Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we &apos; re snobs , because we &apos; re focused on status .
We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment , including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria .
Fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago , and it &apos; s based on the theory that our health and well - being throughout our lives is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb .
Fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy .
Its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age .
Some of the crackles and pops were lightning , but the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin .
As an architect , I often ask myself , what is the origin of the forms that we design ?
That 50th year is called the jubilee year , and it &apos; s the origin of that term .
So since we can make some interesting protocells that we like , interesting colors and interesting behaviors , and they &apos; re very easy to make , and they have interesting lifelike properties , perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the Earth . Perhaps these represent an easily accessible step , one of the first steps by which life got started on the early Earth .
So by making these chemical , artificial life experiments , we hope not only to understand something fundamental about the origin of life and the existence of life on this planet , but also what possible life there could be out there in the universe . Thank you .
If you look at the origins of this , the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here .
This is modifying IBM equipment , which is the origins of the whole data - processing industry , later at IBM .
And this is quite interesting , to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what &apos; s really , in all species , their spring .
It goes back . The origins and roots of technology go back to the Big Bang , in this way , in that they are part of this self - organizing thread that starts at the Big Bang and goes through galaxies and stars , into life , into us .
&quot; And I think that this is really the origin of what you and I call &quot; &quot; love at first sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
The first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as 1899 : radioactivity .
But I &apos; m particularly interested in religion , and the origin of religion , and in what it does to us and for us .

Well , the question of origins , as with so many other questions in biology , seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago .
So we &apos; re done , we can go home -- finished the origin question .
&quot; And they got really excited about it . They liked the film , but they said , &quot; &quot; You know , we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins , where we all came from , using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world . &quot;
&quot; The Committee on Agriculture agreed on the wording &quot; &quot; by 1 January 2002 at the latest &quot; &quot; in a compromise on the introduction of compulsory information on origin , i.e. stage 2 . &quot;
If such a policy is to have a lasting effect , it must form part of the overall approach defined at Tampere , which requires both a more efficient management of migration flows and the development of partnerships with the countries of origin and transit , the establishment of a common asylum system and the guarantee of fair treatment for nationals of third countries who are legally resident in Member States &apos; territory .
Take Poland , Hungary or the Czech Republic , to mention but a few of the &apos; candidate &apos; countries : how could we deny that they share our history , our culture and our origins ?
&quot; We have received a reply from the confederation of producers of registered designation of origin ( AOC ) wine , saying , &quot; &quot; We support the position of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , as it offers the guarantee that European regulations are not going to permit the implementation of procedures to authorise the sale of genetically modified wine - growing materials which may be harmful to the brand image of wine growing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Its origin is in principle exactly the same as that of other biomasses that derive from plants , for example wood .
This proposal was then accepted by the French Presidency and the Swedish Presidency , which intend to establish this network of information and exchange of experiences and best practices to prevent crime through a proposal for a legislative initiative . The undertaking would include the exchange of information and news in as short a time as possible precisely in order to be able to study the origins of criminal phenomena .
Madam President , so that we can gauge the importance of this debate , I should like to start by reminding you of the remote origins of this proposal for a directive ; the Directive on the liberalisation of capital movements of 24 June 1988 .
As regards VAT , the report stresses the need to set up a system that applies in full the country - of - origin principle - prioritising the definitive system - on which the Commission documents are , in our view , still evasive .
This objective is specified but the timescales and procedures for introducing the country - of - origin regime are not given .
Finally , in line with its communications concerning the introduction of open methods of coordination both for immigration and asylum , the Commission will shortly propose the implementation of a European system of information exchange on migration , asylum and countries of origin , as called for by the European Council .
It aims to introduce a single passport for prospectuses , approved by the authorities in the country of origin and subsequently recognised throughout the EU for the purposes of the public offering of securities and / or their admission to trading on regulated markets .
Finally , Mr President , we must also act quickly to guarantee the selection at origin of materials that create less waste , are less harmful and reduce waste as much as possible , since that waste has increased over recent years in the majority of Member States .
Silvio Berlusconi and his enterprises are certainly responsible for choosing , since the 1990s , to turn his media empire of humble origins into an instrument not unlike RAI TV to boost his declining political career .
In any case , both the subject of safe countries of origin and that of safe third countries will be discussed at the next Council meeting at the beginning of October .
I hope that the proper application of this regulation , together with other supporting policies to develop and democratise the countries of origin of illegal immigrants , will significantly improve the deeper social and political problem which affects our societies and provides a breeding ground for a climate of racism and xenophobia which is an insult to the humanitarian and democratic values of European political and social civilisation .
The study analysed the possibilities of the Europe - wide use of protected entry procedures in regions of origin and examined how such procedures could allow a non-national to approach a potential host state outside its territory with an asylum claim and be granted a permit to enter that country .
The proposal to streamline rates should be seen in the context of the process currently underway to establish a definitive VAT system , based on taxation in the country of origin and on a harmonised timescale , with the least number of derogations possible , for taxation rates in the various Member States .
. – This recommendation , which had its origin in an initiative in which my Parliamentary Group took part , was pressing and necessary , although I do not agree with the way all its points have been formulated .
As far as the strand of asylum and immigration is concerned , the Presidency will focus on three elements : strengthening partnerships with countries of origin and of transit ; establishing a harmonised approach with regard to the policy of return and readmission ; and the European Agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders begins its duties on 1 May .
In order to understand the decision of 9 June 2004 one must go back to the origins of this matter .
At the beginning of January 2004 , the Commission presented to the Council a Green Paper entitled &apos; The future of rules of origin in preferential trade arrangements &apos; .
The need to take account of the end of the life cycle when designing new motor vehicles has its origins in the early 1990s , in the Netherlands amongst others , when bilateral agreements were concluded between manufacturers and the authorities .
We will carefully consider the possibility of introducing special labels of origin for processed products made exclusively from European raw materials .
The fact that the amendment that I tabled for introducing labels of origin for processed products has been accepted is a step forwards .
The issuing of certificates of origin should form a mandatory part of these inspections , and the Commission should consider introducing import quotas for these sensitive products .
As regards the introduction of special labelling of origin , I can assure you that I will be positive in my approach to that .
Thirdly : the introduction of a non -EU mark of origin , which will also apply to products that are only partially manufactured in third countries .
I would again insist on the fact that , while the formal involvement of your institution is based on the legal framework for the definition of rules of origin in the various preferential arrangements , I consider it extremely important that your committee be kept fully informed and have the opportunity to express it s views on the charges to be introduced for the benefit of better market access and development .
I will conclude by stating that we would have liked more clarity on other points , for instance the inclusion of an active strategy for consumer awareness and more precise words with regard to the immediate introduction – and I am pleased that the Commissioner said it – of a mark of origin for all textile and clothing goods , precisely in order to protect and revive one of the strengths of our production .
I am talking about the introduction of a compulsory non -EU origin label , to be applied to raw materials too .
Consequently , research into the origin and causes of these diseases is urgently needed , in order to improve treatments and compare results .
One danger arising from the planned introduction of a minimum common list of what are termed ‘ safe third countries ’ is the major one that the Member States will return asylum- seekers to countries of origin that are regarded as ‘ safe third countries ’ without either the reasons for these individuals having become refugees being heard or their entitlement to asylum being examined .
Otherwise , I support the proposal to set up a system for labelling products with their country of origin .
I would also point out that another fundamental request , which is the compulsory introduction of a label of origin for products entering the EU , has been dragging on for two years without the Member States being able to come to agreement .
The establishment of the protected designation of origin ( PDO ) , the protected geographical indication ( PGI ) and the traditional speciality guaranteed ( TSG ) is a step in the right direction for the development of rural areas .

As the Chairman of my party , Mariano Rajoy , proposed a few months ago in Paris , a specific obligatory subject should be created in all colleges and schools in the Member States , which would cover the origin , the objectives and the operation of the European Union &apos; s institutions .
Accordingly , we must draft common European return policy as a matter of urgency – in respect of which I should like to remark that everyone , legal or illegal , is entitled to respectful and dignified treatment – which should include awareness and information campaigns in the countries of origin and transit , concluding association and cooperation agreements with those countries , creating a clear link between immigration policy and adopting development policy and , vitally , the swift introduction of a European green card .
It has been so from the time that the Barcelona Process was instituted , but it has continued in all other issues of our relations with the countries of origin and transit .
We propose , for example , putting in place financial support for immigrants in their countries of origin .
There is not a single word about putting policies in place for returning illegal immigrants to their countries of origin .
The introduction of the country of origin principle , at least provisionally , is a very interesting idea insofar as it would confer on victims rights with which they are familiar .
Furthermore , the indirect introduction of the country of origin principle is in our view also inappropriate as a means of protecting consumer interests .
However , it is also obvious that , since its origins in 1985 , with the Foz de Iguazú declaration and the Treaty of Asunción in 1991 , the European Union has been very close to what was then in its infancy and is now a reality .
It is interesting to note that shortly after Lyell published the above - mentioned book , Charles Darwin ’ s The Origin of Species appeared .
This fact was first perceived by Charles Darwin in his classic book ‘ Origin of Species ’ ( 1859 ) , where he expressed his belief that more of geologic time is represented by breaks than by strata . ”
We have many legends in Laos about the origin of the human race , but none of them , as I recall , mention a Creator .
On the other hand , there is the so - called science that interprets and tries to explain the origin of things by means of hypotheses and theories .
Even Charles Darwin admitted the absurdity of his natural selection theory when he considered the eye : “ To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances , for admitting different amounts of light and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration , could have been formed by natural selection , seems , I freely confess , absurd in the highest degree . ” — The Origin of Species , p .
Thus , by 1972 newer explanations of man ’ s origin had developed among evolutionists .
This was even noted in the foreword of a special edition of Darwin ’ s famous book Origin of Species .
Thompson , who was selected to write the foreword to a centennial edition of Darwin ’ s Origin of Species had this to say : ‘ As we know , there is a great divergence of opinion among biologists , not only about the causes of evolution but even about the actual process .
In a book supporting evolution , Processes of Organic Evolution , we read : “ To be sure , no biologist has actually seen the origin by evolution of a major group of organisms . ”
“ For years prior to the first lunar landing , scientists argued the merits of various theories &#91; of the moon ’ s origin &#93; with great intensity , but the battle ended in a stalemate ....

After two years , which included some of the most interesting and enjoyable experiences of my life , I am convinced more than ever that evolutionary explanations for the origin of the species have no scientific basis .
In 1859 evolutionist Charles Darwin had his book The Origin of Species published .
Darwin ’ s theory of the origin of species by evolution was published in 1859 , and quickly stirred intense religious objection .
This setback was disappointing to many who hold that evolution does not satisfactorily explain life ’ s origin .
Are the doctrines of recent creation and a diluvial origin of geologic strata found in God ’ s Word ?
With the basic point established that the Bible text does not conflict with scientific theories about the age of the universe , we may also leave open the question of the age and origin of geologic strata .

As Francis Crick said : “ An honest man , armed with all the knowledge available to us now , could only state that in some sense , the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle . ”
&quot; And with this famous entry in his notebook , he begins in the top left - hand corner with , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; and then sketches out the first tree of life , which is his perception of how all the species , all living things on Earth , are connected through evolutionary history -- the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population . &quot;
&quot; Astronomer Dimitar Sasselov and his colleagues search for Earth - like planets that may , someday , help us answer centuries - old questions about the origin and existence of biological life elsewhere . Preliminary results show that they have found 706 &quot; &quot; candidates &quot; &quot; -- some of which further research may prove to be planets with Earth - like geochemical characteristics . &quot;
In this case , the hand would move and we &apos; d see it waving at us in Middle World . The odds against it , of course , are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe , you still would not have written enough zeros to this day .
And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it , we &apos; re allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion .
Another consequence of this recent origin of modern humans is that genetic variants are generally distributed widely in the world , in many places , and they tend to vary as gradients , from a bird &apos; s - eye perspective at least .
&quot; And it &apos; s the 150th anniversary of the publication of &quot; &quot; The Origin of Species . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Water is the key ingredient in the evolution , the origin of life on a planet .
&quot; And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book , &quot; &quot; On the Origin of Species , &quot; &quot; published 150 years ago . &quot;
&quot; Now what is so interesting and to some , the extent , what &apos; s a bit infamous about &quot; &quot; The Origin of Species , &quot; &quot; is that there is only one line in it about human evolution . &quot;
Well he didn &apos;t write anything about it in The Origin of Species .
The entire line is divided into 3,000 - meter ( 2 - mile ) blocks and the controller at the control station can follow each train on a panel .
There you can see a panel that shows all the traffic on the entire line from Tokyo to Kyushu .
Operators in the control room keep close watch on the panel and direct necessary information to the individual trains .
And an OFF indication appears on the panel if the airplane is too far away or flying too low for satisfactory reception . ”
Several red and amber warning lights illuminate the instrument panels as the first officer tries to straighten out the turn .
For long - distance radio communications , stations 3,000 miles apart have each used a twenty - square - foot panel of solar batteries containing more than 7,800 individual solar cells as the sole power source .
These panels may consist of aluminum sheets painted with a special heat - absorbent black coating .
I reinforced each panel with three steel rods running its length .
Then I used a centrifugal pump that is designed for a high volume of water ( about one hundred gallons &#91; 380 liters &#93; per minute ) to wash a large enough hole in the sand to accommodate a panel .
Each panel was tilted shoreward about thirty - five degrees from vertical .
Now something was immediately needed on the shore side of these panels .
Some of the Witnesses had worked full time for several months , first cutting the leaves on their home island of Malaita , then traveling with them to Honiara where they were sewed into panels .
Then came the erection of timber frames and the closing in of the houses with the leaf panels .
So , we have two panels here , of colored dots .
And one of those dots is the same in the two panels . Okay ?
And we talk about the world flattens as being this panel , and I am very optimistic .
These areas of our cities are often home to single - parent families , elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity , and families facing difficulties ; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society .
The presumed killer , Sid Ahmed Rezala , is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake , who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents , and another young woman , Émilie Bazin , who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived .

When 13 - year - old school children play on the computer after school at restructuring their parents &apos; share portfolios , then this has more to do with toy casinos than with responsibility .
I think it is important to formulate an objective in this respect , Mr President - in-Office , that is to say to challenge all Member States to stamp out social exclusion of all citizens in our society , not only children , but also their parents and the elderly .
It is just as unacceptable to see families torn apart with children sometimes being left alone following the expulsion of their parents who have no right of residence , even though some have lived and worked in Europe for nearly ten years .
Respect for human dignity must be our guide . We must ensure that poverty is not allowed to destroy individuals and families , that children are not taken away from their parents because of poverty and that the simple right of association is not refused to those who do not even have the right to work .
Parents are powerless in the face of this phenomenon because they can not keep up with this technological progress .
Many had difficult childhoods and now face problems as parents .
Namely , parents use methods of verbal and physical punishment because they don ’ t know of any other way and they were brought up the same way .
Maybe parents punish children because they are not informed about the new correctional trends , and maybe that is the only way to control them .

When faced with a parent suffering from Alzheimer &apos; s , most of us respond with denial or extreme efforts at prevention . But global health expert and TED Fellow Alanna Shaikh sees it differently . She &apos; s taking three concrete steps to prepare for the moment -- should it arrive -- when she herself gets Alzheimer &apos; s disease .
But imagine the impact on a family : if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school , that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .
Think about the Beatrices , think about the Adenikes of this world , who are doing incredible things , that are bringing them into the global economy , whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed , and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income .
&quot; The baby sits on a parent &apos; s lap , and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes -- like from &quot; &quot; ah &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; ee . &quot; &quot; &quot;

The return to work after taking a break to have a family must be facilitated just as much as parallel working and childrearing for both parents , for it has been shown by a European comparative study that countries with a well - developed range of childcare options have overall a higher percentage of women going out to work , particularly where those women are the mothers of more than one child in need of care .
Children are our future ; they are the workers , the consumers and the parents of tomorrow .
I also would like to remember a little bit the past : how difficult it was before we accepted the first company taxation directives - a Parent - Subsidiary Directive and an Interest and Royalties Directive in the 1990s - to speak about these items .
But they are now there after serious discussion , and I still believe that we can have all the practical things , like anti-abusive measures , that we can improve the Parent - Subsidiary Directive and that we can improve the workings of the Transfer Pricing Forum , and such initiatives are very much needed .
EU projects have already proved successful by addressing post -natal depression in mothers , improving parenting skills , organising home visits by nurses to assist future and new parents and providing resources for schools .
The first one was the expansion of the framework of Directive 90 / 435 / EC on the common system of taxation for parent and subsidiary companies through Council Directive 2003 / 123 / ES , which eliminates the economic and legal double taxation of cross-border flows of dividends within the framework of the Community .

Apart from supporting mothers , this report also recommends states to introduce fully paid parental leave , thereby recognising the role of both parents in bringing up children .
I am calling for innovative ideas to be implemented as quickly as possible with regard to childcare and work - family balance , in order to enable mothers as well as fathers to play their role of parents fully .
Verbatim , the report states ( in paragraph 14 ) that &apos; &#91; The European Parliament &#93; stresses that parents , both mothers and fathers , are equal partners in ECEC &#91; early childhood education and care &#93; ; ( ... ) &apos; .
If parent and subsidiary companies simply provide groundhandling services for each other , then we must seriously ask ourselves whether competition is genuinely being ensured !
Either one takes the Commission &apos; s line by including every controlling or controlled company within the definition of parent and subsidiary companies , or one chooses the amendment s that would understand both terms in the stricter sense of the previous guidelines .

Our financial control system does not have the quantity of payments that the Commission has and therefore things are more manageable .
It complained about the pre-dating of contracts and a high overall error rate in payment audits due to incorrect proof of or information on costs , an error rate for which the Commission is perhaps not 100 % responsible , but is at least 90 % responsible .
Payments as a proportion of total commitments have fallen over many years and barely 80 per cent of commitments , reportedly , are paid out .
In terms of volume , commitments , i.e. sums that will need to be converted to payments in later years , were around EUR 71 billion at the end of 1999 .
I am pleased that the Commission really has taken note of the problem and intends doing what it can to ensure that the payments are made more quickly .

If people would look at what is being done with the buildings : we are trying to reduce the payments over the shortest possible time , thereby reducing the total burden on Parliament &apos; s budget .
I think that this figure clearly illustrates that the preliminary draft budget is in keeping with the overall policy of budgetary rigour , and that the rate of increase in payments as a whole , without agricultural expenditure , is 3 % .

The firms affected by this measure are those which , on the one hand , provide services of general economic interest in exchange for various different types of compensation , which may be special dues or payments , and , on the other , also perform normal general activities , thereby operating in competition with other firms .
On Mozambique , for instance , it is very significant that the IMF , the World Bank and the Paris Club only postponed payments from Mozambique and then actually lent more money .
The Council &apos; s view is correct : payments to farmers are at stake .
This was because this report repeatedly states that we must react to the fact that the population is ageing and control it - the number of elderly people is constantly increasing , making it difficult to maintain pension systems - and that we need to be vigilant and call upon the Member States to spend increasingly less money on pension payments for the elderly .
Neither would I want the payment of a few subsidies to these associations to be used as a pretext for justifying a reduction in the number of police officers or court officials who must now be trained .

This source of information is found in the administrative information resulting from the payments of the EAGGF .
Regulation ( EC ) No 2390 / 1999 demands that the Member States provide the Commission with the data on the payments of the EAGGF - Guarantee .
This approach must be applied systematically and must be based on the analysis of the payments corresponding to each regulation .

Data on payments or revenue in respect of the EAGGF , Guarantee section , can only be used at the request of the Commission for closing accounts .

The elderly who must live on small fixed incomes from pensions , Social Security payments and the like keenly feel today ’ s spiraling inflation .
In the Soviet Union and China the entire amount is financed by the place where a person has worked , or by supplementary payments from the government .
Thus , some may feel that there are advantages in buying on credit , such as : ( 1 ) having the immediate use of the goods ; ( 2 ) no price increase due to inflation ; ( 3 ) complaints often attended to more promptly since good relations are desired with the customer because he still owes money ; ( 4 ) monthly payments can be taken as a sort of compulsory saving .

Thus , if some earnings are weekly , but payment is monthly , or even yearly , you enclose the cash needed up till that week so as to have the required amount when bill - paying time arrives .

We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon , which has been accepted , will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists .
However , the people are fighting back , as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit . The leaders of the world , headed unfortunately by the European Commission , rushed forward submissively , hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world , Mr Clinton , would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table .
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south .
Secondly , Madam President , we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people .
“ Rather than send a president and a minister to get a sun tan with Nicolas Sarkozy on Place de la Concorde during the Bastille Day parade , the Syrian regime has a duty to inform it s people about that prison , to stop the killing immediately , to hold fair trials , and to free all political and opinion detainees . ”

Iranian - born artist Shirin Neshat explores the paradox of being an artist in exile : a voice for her people , but unable to go home . In her work , she explores Iran pre - and post -Islamic Revolution , tracing political and societal change through powerful images of women .
Oddly enough , an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice , the speaker of my people , even if I have , indeed , no access to my own country .
We are the reporters of our people , and are communicators to the outside world .
Our people depend on our artists , and culture is beyond communication .
Stories can break the dignity of a people , but stories can also repair that broken dignity .
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
There is the people , and then there is the government or leaders .
20 out of 204 means that the vast majority of the African leaders failed their people .
By raking it off the backs of their suffering people .
Without the council the chief can &apos;t pass any law , and if the chief doesn &apos;t govern according to the will of the people he will be removed .
If not , the people will abandon the chief , go somewhere else and set up a new settlement .
That &apos; s where you find the African people .
But if there &apos; s a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them either . That is true .
&quot; When Mandela came out of prison after 27 years of captivity , if he had told his people , &quot; &quot; It &apos; s time to take up the arms , it &apos; s time to fight , &quot; &quot; he would have been followed . &quot;

Mr President , this is an important and urgent matter , and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly , because today , you must realise , men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero , these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid .

When I write for Global Voices , I feel like I contribute so that the culture of my country is known , the way people see things from the point of view of bloggers , and through their perceptions they give a vision distinct from what one normally seen .
We just seek to get the word out and inform people about us .
Unfortunately , these people were simply ignorant of the “ rules , ” some willfully so , and are now facing the consequences .
And I am sure so many people are getting to know him for the very first time even as I write .
In Hong Kong , many people are disapointed , Uncle Ray said that Jackie Chan is heartless to talk like that :
People also like to buy flowers for the festive season .
Though in the past the celebration would go on till the fifteenth day , the busy life people lead nowadays seldom allows them to continue it that long .
On that day people receive the Money God into their houses with offerings of incense and sacrifices , hoping that this will bring them prosperity in the new year .
People at these settlements , by the way , are very friendly .
Yet , many hardworking people view any other course as impractical .
In Mexico City in September 1965 , rush - hour traffic was jammed for several evenings in a row , and people passed the nights on rooftops to watch moving lights in the sky .
During a spate of “ flying saucer ” reports , it has not been uncommon to see groups of people gathered on street corners to stare at a tiny white spot in the sky .
People within fifty miles of its path saw groups of bright lights pass slowly overhead .
In a country where we enjoy the benefits of a “ free ” National Health Service and where many people are living on pills , such tragedies are stark reminders of the dangers of drugs .
But what about those pills that people are taking every day without apparent harm , pills that some doctors are prone to over - prescribe or that can readily be bought without prescription from the local chemist or druggist ?
What &apos; ll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here , and they will accumulate in the drunkest , stingiest people .
And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this .
People actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole .
AK : A month later , we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
Come here . Stand here where people can see you .
And it &apos; s driven and propelled forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos; ve seen here , and by new pressures .
Now , I &apos; m going to take you to Los Angeles , and lots of people know that L.A. has its issues .
So ultimately , 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided , and electrical consumption for air - conditioning went down , while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up , resulting in a net - savings to the system , but also healthier students and schools system employees as well .
I spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
Didn &apos;t have to worry about what people thought about me .
The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical . And the second is very counterintuitive -- you can get the best people in the world .
We &apos; ve got money in the bank . It &apos; s because you get the best people .
We couldn &apos;t afford to hire a CFO . We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary , and we had a queue of people .
It allows you to team up with people . The U.N. &apos; s not going to be our partner if we &apos; re profit making . So announcing this with Kofi Annan was very important , and the U.N. allowed us to basically reach all the countries . And this was the machine we were showing before I met Yves Behar .
In spite of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design , cheap labor , cheap components , and making a cheap laptop .
&quot; And the &quot; &quot; Give One , Get One &quot; &quot; program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested . &quot;
&quot; The first day it was just wild . And then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos; s get people to give many . Not just one , and get one , but maybe give 100 , give 1,000 . &quot; &quot; And that &apos; s where you come in . &quot;
. ( PT ) We fundamentally reject the principle of allowing chocolate to be produced throughout the Member States using a percentage of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter .
At the same time , allowing up to 5 % vegetable fats other than cocoa butter to be used in chocolate production sets a dangerous precedent , given that , in the long term , it may lead not just to the use of a higher percentage of these fats than set at present , but it may also open the way to chocolate being produced with other kinds of fat in future , including even genetically modified fats .
At present , there is still a 50 % limit on state aid in relation to the overall cost of any given project , but this percentage could even be raised to 60 % in special cases envisaged in the programme .
At the moment we have no indication that the Commission is considering a lowering of this limit , let alone the amount and the percentage mentioned by the honourable Member .
Here we can clearly see from empirical studies that network access is by far the best way to achieve high percentages of renewable energy rather than the other methods that have been undertaken in those countries .
I do not know how large a percentage of the Member States &apos; budgets disappears due to fraud and irregularities .
The reason for this high percentage is that we do not want to take the risk of sending Finnish wagons to Russia , since experience shows that they are so very rarely returned .
In percentage terms , trains have certainly not retained their share in transport .
The average Greek taxpayer pays more than other Europeans but total tax revenues in Greece are much lower as a percentage of GDP .

&quot; By way of background to racist violence in the new federal states , she quotes the &quot; &quot; dramatically high percentage &quot; &quot; of racist attitudes among the population , including the fact that racism is being elevated to &quot; &quot; a kind of youth culture &quot; &quot; . &quot;
Since the Commissioner doubts whether sufficient progress has been made in respect of information and preparation , I would also like to ask whether he has any statistics on what percentage of the changeover has been completed in SMEs - let us stick with them - in the different countries , and I would especially like to ask if he has any details on Greece .

Then there is the definition of the percentage that confers control over the company , which ties in with other provisions in the field of company law , which differ considerably from Member State to Member State .
There are now some - and they include a majority of the committee - who say they want a European tax , to which the rapporteur has rightly replied that such a tax could only cover a tiny percentage of the world &apos; s air traffic and , more crucially , that it would create a huge problem for European industry .
We have greater cause for concern about the future of farming in the European Union than ever before as a result of this mainly consumer - led crisis of confidence , given that the number of farmers under the age of 35 has been showing the sharpest decline for some time and now stands at 28 % and that the percentage of farmers in the population of almost every Member State is falling .
I would point out that safety is the priority in air transport . Safety can be considered to be based on two elements : the technical element , such as the resources , aircraft , airports , radio aid , air traffic control and so on and so forth , and then the human element , which is extremely important and , although not the principal cause , has been found to be a contributing factor in an extremely high percentage of aircraft accidents .
This balance must not , of course , drop below 40 % for each sex , which is considered an acceptable percentage , especially in Scandinavia , where it has been applied for years now .
The removal of the vertebral column is regarded by the scientists to account for an additional couple of percentage points so that , in the context of the whole question of the removal of specific risk material , this is an ultra-precautionary measure .
Motorcycles constitute a very small percentage of traffic volume .

With regard to the first package of proposals , which aims at revision in the sense of increasing the rates of assistance under the Structural Funds , it is important to make a greater effort by slightly increasing the Community co-funding percentages , particularly as regards agri-environmental measures and public aid to the productive sector , given that these regions are among the poorest in the European Union and their production , processing and marketing structures need to be strengthened .
I always thought it was marvellous that the percentage of gross national product coming into European spending was declining .
Secondly , the percentage of the number of officials in such a body will need to be determined on a case - by - case basis .
The budgetary forecasts approved in Agenda 2000 for the present period are extremely restrictive , which means that , whereas in 1999 the percentage of the European Union &apos; s GDP dedicated to cohesion policy reached 0.46 % , in 2006 it will not exceed 0.31 % , a return to 1994 levels . These figures are extremely worrying .
It is too small for that , even in the area of Structural Funds , for even the most generous beneficiaries receive a very small percentage of GNP .
The ACP countries win a much higher percentage of contracts under the EDF than from almost any other major donor .
I fully subscribe to his view that it is sheer madness to think that we produce excellent films in Europe , while only 22 % of those end up in cinemas , not to mention the percentage of non-national films that are being shown in the Member States , despite the fact that for people of all ages , film is the ideal medium to get to know each other &apos; s culture .
I know that we have been criticised for not making sufficient progress with this directive , but we are still trying to achieve our objective of doubling the percentage of renewable energy sources by the end of this decade .

The indicators include amongst others Internet penetration in business and the percentage of companies selling online .
Recent investigations by the Greek authorities , together with other available data , reveal that 10.5 % of businesses are not registered with the Social Security Institution and that the percentage of non-registered workers fluctuates between 21 % and 30 % , resulting in a loss of billions of euro from the public purse and , in particular , the social insurance funds .
I could also - if I was not as cautious a man as I am - point to progress already in increasing the percentage of payments in relation to commitments .
The figures available to us on the scale of this phenomenon at Community level can not be underestimated , because they affect a considerable percentage of the population of the Union European between 15 and 65 years of age .
Their share still ranges only between 10 % and 20 % , with the percentage of women owning small and medium - sized enterprises under 20 % .
I welcome their attempt to give customers a percentage breakdown in their bills and in information leaflets explaining the origin of electricity and the effects on the production of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste , and to apply this to imported energy .
The general approach to the discharge procedure is to look at the percentage of the budget line that is spent .
We must not , therefore , try to deny the reality of the situation and bear in mind that , although it is difficult to analyse the correlation between public expenditure and social protection on the one hand and the risk of poverty on the other , it is fair to say that without social transfers , notably old age pensions , 41 % of the population of the European Union would be at risk from poverty , a percentage which would still be 26 % if we included old age pensions but excluded income from other social transfers .
For anyone suffering from an allergy , it is no good saying that it is only an insignificant percentage of people who have it .
In other words , even with the pre-accession funds , we are trying to ensure that the candidate countries do not dump their transport onto the roads and that they maintain a percentage at least equivalent to the current figure in the rail sector .
I also think that we should provide more advice for the candidate countries on how to put together their proposals and increase the percentage of Community funding .
A large percentage of the overall assistance is allocated to institution building and it is increasing all the time .
We therefore ask the Commission , in it s next report , to provide an adequate analysis based on comparable statistics , which enables a gender impact assessment to be made in areas linked to the electoral process , such as the percentage of women voters , of women who stand as candidates and , of course , of women who are elected .

Some of this pigment can be added to feeds , thereby assuring that the yolks will have a desirable color .
Because various substances called pigments absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others .

Such variations are made by diluting a color with a neutral pigment , either white or black .
So the unstable chlorophyll in the leaves begins to break down and fade away , revealing the colorful pigments already there .
These are mainly the carotenoids , pigments responsible for colors from pale yellow ( xanthophylls ) to carrot color ( carotenes ) .

&quot; And I &apos; m hopeful because it &apos; s not only philanthropy that &apos; s reorganizing itself , it &apos; s also whole other portions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging &quot; &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Three - dimensional play fires up the cerebellum , puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe -- the executive portion -- helps contextual memory be developed , and -- and , and , and .
Let &apos; s listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television .
And if you &apos; re like me , you &apos; re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
We use skeletal muscles so much . It &apos; s the one portion of our body -- our heart &apos; s always beating . We &apos; re always moving our muscles .
Few Bogatanos own cars , yet a huge portion of the city &apos; s resources was dedicated to serving them .
However , what occurred to me was human - caused destruction , which was not only causing a significant portion of the destruction , but actually it was accelerating .
These are millennial structures -- portions of the tree that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old .
If a portion of a Redwood is rotting , the Redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart .
This means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file , plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality .
And if this happens , an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley .
So there are some pathological liars , but they make up a tiny portion of the population . We lie for a reason .
You have the middle area , where the temporal lobe might be , in here , and the posterior portion , where the maintenance functions are in the back .
And , you can see , there &apos; s an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain , where he &apos; s got images of his family , into this area , which is powering his will .
&quot; Robert Kennedy once said that &quot; &quot; few of us have the greatness to bend history itself , but each of us can work to change a small portion of events . &quot; &quot; &quot;
He doesn &apos;t lose the water right , he just chooses to apply that right , or some portion of it , to the stream , instead of to the land .
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high - ranking positions in the environmental field .
With regard more specifically to your question , I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way .
There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office .
Unfortunately , this is not the case and currently , by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35 - hour law , which is purely French , but also by changing the working time criteria , such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400 , as previously , in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed .
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage , because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe .
Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service , which decided , for instance , to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas .
I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste .
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed .
For us in Finland , a sparsely populated country , a visit to the post office is a social event .
This applies both to the post and other sectors .
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision - making power , to gain responsible posts in the political arena , but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think .
&quot; It is quite extraordinary that at the moment , in the so - called &quot; &quot; new economy &quot; &quot; sectors , there is a shortfall of around 800 000 qualified people for existing posts at the same time that there are millions of people unemployed . &quot;
As we put it in Brussels on 1 March , that kind of policy would reflect a profound contempt for women : women should gain access to political or administrative posts not through the mechanical workings of some form of quota but through the recognition of their merits and abilities .
The institutions can not respond to enlargement by just adding an extra post here or an office there .
The Internet , Minitel , the post are nothing more than the medium .
The recruitment procedure for the remaining six posts has already been completed , or will be shortly .
&quot; Here it states and I quote : &quot; &quot; deplores most strongly the residual impression left by these cases , whereby it would appear that favouritism plays a significant role in the granting of appointments to high - grade posts within the administration of Parliament &quot; &quot; . &quot;
That panel makes an objective assessment of the professional and managerial qualities and capabilities that are relevant to the post and recommends a shortlist .
It is clear from the current debate that the European Parliament has asked the Commission to rotate senior posts and has already lent its support to this idea .
In fact , the Commission too has admitted to this , without rushing to attach national identity to the individual figures , individual posts , because we would then be back to square one , as we would be pushing aside the merits of the case and forcing the national flags back into use , which would take each one of us some time to digest .
According to Belarusian blogger and activist Zmieter Soltan ( listen below to our podcast interview with Zmieter ) , the campaign involved several Belarusian online communities on LiveJournal : “ There were multiple posts with photos of Dzianis , updates on the investigation of his case , on the likely charges which would be put against him , photos of his mother and girlfriend , reports about the event when he was arrested , regular updates on the money raised to date , accounts from visits to the prison . ”
Enough with politics that usually dominate the posts in the Bangladeshi blogosphere .
Today I &apos; d like to share with you a post written by Wahda Maseyya - An Egyptian Girl - about the Muslim Brotherhood party and her thoughts about their ideologies .
The emotionally charged post attracted a pour of comments and prayers for the lost seamen .
We have collected these posts on a Special Coverage page that includes live feeds of what bloggers in the region , from Bahrain to Morocco , are writing about about and their hopes for the future .
This post has received 243 reader comments so far .
A selection of three posts from January were translated for the international audience of Foko which can be found here .
A selection of five of the February posts of the FOKO bloggers were translated on the Foko Blog Club page .
&quot; Perhaps , it is true , as it gives you some kind of &quot; &quot; immunity &quot; &quot; from the checks , competition and possible prosecution — the higher the post , the more you get . &quot;
Contrary to what human rights sites have been saying about the protest held for political reasons , Ahmad ends his post by explaining the real reasons behind this second protest in the Syrian prison :
His reaction in a post entitled Impossible Missionary was simple :
No , that was not emphasized enough in this post to show all of our conversations and actions , but wow … that doesn ’ t mean that my husband doesn ’ t feel for the people here !
Maybe I can convince him to write another post , but I ’ m not sure because it may be best just to leave this rather than getting things torn apart again .
Its decisions will have important effects on the 550,000 post offices around the world , and for the 4,500,000 persons employed in handling the more than 250,000 million postal items per year for inland and foreign transit .
He was a disgrace to the Chair of Peter , ” The Catholic Encyclopedia tells us.Others report that he “ was one of the most profligate ever to occupy the post . ”
Said one of them : “ On account of filthy lucre you will not find a Pope willing to give up his post for the sake of the peace of the Church . ”
I thought that this job would be ideal and applied for the post .
The Post reports that according to The New England Journal of Medicine , unwashed hands among doctors and nurses “ may help explain why hospital patients develop infections that cost up to $ 10 billion a year to cure . ”
Yet , it “ still receives about five broken culture vials in the post each year , ” says New Scientist .
Can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003 , when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30 - year history ?
You just go to the website , fill out the form , give them $ 60 , and it arrives in the post .
And I was mentioning Abed and myself , noting deliberately that I was here in peace , to the people in this town , when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon .
So governments from Russia to China to Iran are actually hiring , training and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues . Right ?
So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts , they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries .
The pillory was similar , being a wooden framework erected on a post , with holes for the head and hands of the offender , who would be in a standing position .
Then lots of poles and posts came rushing through in the water .
Notice the expertly carved post at the side of the tokonoma .
A single post may cost a thousand dollars or more !
“ They sat on a network of horizontal beams propped up by short posts resting on rocks . ”
One , bigger than the others , was chained to a post to give the smaller ones a chance .
Some have large windows opening onto projecting , covered balconies that sit upon wooden posts as if resting on stilts .
All these proteins are “ the cell ’ s equivalent of posts , beams , plywood , cement , and nails , ” says The Way Life Works .
As you observe a gondola , you might be surprised that it moves in a straight line , given that there is only one oar fixed to the right of the boat on an oar post .
These posts mark the way when sandstorms obscure the road .
“ Happy is the man that is listening to me by keeping awake at my doors day by day , by watching at the posts of my entrances .
Says wisdom personified : “ Happy is the man that is listening to me by keeping awake at my doors day by day , by watching at the posts of my entrances .
The entrance faced east and was divided by five posts behind which hung a curtain colorfully embroidered .
Dividing the larger Holy from the Most Holy were four posts behind which hung a similar curtain or veil .
The curtains draped on posts around the courtyard of the tent separated that holy place from the surrounding encampment of the Israelites .
In Proverbs 8 : 34 , 35 Wisdom personified speaks to us , saying : “ Happy is the man that is listening to me by keeping awake at my doors day by day , by watching at the posts of my entrances .
It therefore means happiness and life and divine goodwill toward us if we go to places where Jehovah ’ s “ men of goodwill ” meet together and wait regularly at the posts of the entrances there in order to go inside to hear the discussion of God ’ s written Word of wisdom , away from the wisdom of this world .
People stared from under the eaves , which projected over the sidewalks and were supported by posts .
Some of the men who leaned against the posts wore gun belts with revolvers .
Happy is the man that is listening to me by keeping awake at my doors day by day , by watching at the posts of my entrances .
The intiwatana , the hitching post to the sun , is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light that falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu , which is Sugarloaf Mountain , called Huayna Picchu .
Lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
Melanie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrotum .
Melanie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
Pre - Columbian ( before Columbus ) artists depicted these giant worms on pottery , and a search for them was started in 1956 .
Coarse , heavy plant materials usually are displayed in a heavy container of copper , pottery , wood or pewter .
Circumstantial evidence , in the form of artifacts and remains ( pottery , fragments , ruins , debris from previous civilizations , skeletons and the like ) , is dug up .
Many centuries before Christ , Finnish peasants mixed it in pottery and chinked cracks in their log huts with it .
Paintings , figurines , wood carvings , pottery , or other objects can usually be found in gift and curio shops .
Most of them make their pottery in the traditional way that dates back to about the 1500 ’ s .
An oven is created by stacking pieces of firewood on end and placing more wood over the top of the upright pieces , shaping them like an oven with an open end for inserting the pottery .
The hill served as a kind of acropolis for the local Celtic community , who produced pottery and struck coins .
Some of the geometric patterns they used can still be found in contemporary pottery designs .
And no wonder , for these ancient inhabitants of Belize , El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras , and Mexico were the producers of exceptional architecture , painting , pottery , and sculpture !
Stuart , in his book Ancient Pioneers — The First Americans , states : “ To many archaeologists and art historians , the platform mounds , carefully arranged around plazas , ” and some of the pottery “ demonstrate clear influences , perhaps indirect , from Mesoamerica — as do the strains of maize and beans present at the sites . ”
( Insight , the Smithsonian newsletter ) There are baskets , pottery , and beadwork representing tribes as far apart as the Mapuche in Chile , the Quechua in Peru , the Lakota in the United States , and the Anishinabe in Canada .
Or as Yadin puts it : “ Sure enough , not only did Dever ’ s team find the other half of the gate , but the stratigraphy and pottery demonstrated conclusively that the complex had been built in Solomon ’ s times . ”
A display of pieces of broken pottery demonstrates the extent of first - century travel as revealed in the Scriptures .
In just one ancient warehouse , pottery fragments were found from such widely separated places as Yugoslavia , Italy , Spain , and perhaps North Africa .
Well no , not pieces of plastic , but stone seals , copper tablets , pottery and , surprisingly , one large sign board , which was found buried near the gate of a city .
But I had the presence of mind to give the teachers &apos; classes that I cut the pottery that I made , and they gave me passing grades .
So off we drove to the remote place in the country where the villagers are clay - pottery experts .
Several words in the Malagasy language describe this essential stage of pottery making : hitsahina , disahina , tehafina , volavolaina , totoina .
Biblical cities , kings and nations suddenly came to life through discovery of clay tablets , pottery , statues , inscriptions and long - buried ruins .
It also was famed for its gold - woven clothes , the vestes Attilae , its pottery and its precious ointments .
The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy ; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision - making powers as regards funding , i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe , which is why we voted against this text .
Add to that the private and public spheres and the losses total 20 TWh per year , which corresponds to the output of two large power stations that we are simply running for no purpose .
Major improvements in the environmental sphere also need to be made and , as Mr Markov pointed out , purchasing power needs to be increased and care taken to create demand so that companies can dare to begin investing again and so that we can invest in quality and in initiatives that help enable us to comply with the ambitious Lisbon objectives .
. ( PT ) In the first four years of MAGP IV ( 1997 - 2001 ) the Community fleet was reduced by 2.5 % in terms of tonnage and 5.9 % in terms of power .
The EU should use its development assistance and other external powers to pursue the objective of binding minimum standards with respect to the social and environmental performance of companies .
This is an incredible achievement on the part of Lithuania , because this nuclear power station is about as important to the Lithuanian economy as the automobile industry is to Germany .
We are all aware that the deep sea fishing fleet has rapidly increased in power and capacity .
But let us also be clear : the European Union itself can only function at full power whether we are talking of humanitarian aid or of reconstruction within a framework that has been legitimised by the United Nations and as an equal partner of the US and not as a subcontractor .
It is due , above all , to a policy , described as one of reform , which is in thrall to profit , wrecks workers ’ rights , encourages wage dumping , and privatises social security benefits , thereby helping to strangle mass purchasing power and to increase poverty in Europe .
I am referring to the principle of progressive access and the fundamental role of training ; the need not to discriminate between car drivers and motorcyclists in the issuing of licences ; the awareness that speed and the power / weight ratio must be regarded as one of the main causes of accidents ; and the fact that the situation across Europe is highly diversified .
Furthermore , with regard to the system for calculating fishing effort , we believe that the one presented by the Commission , based on kilowatts of power , is too complicated and we therefore propose that it be based on fishing days and that , furthermore , we establish a system of co-responsibility for fishermen in the control of fishing .
The International Energy Agency has calculated that if computer manufacturers were simply forced to reduce the amount of energy consumed by computers in standby mode to one watt , instead of the current ten watts , this would save the equivalent of twenty 1 000 megawatt power plants .
In the long term , the replacement of engines without reducing their power must be supported .
Well , that is one way of driving the indigenous population away , and all for useless turbines producing insignificant amounts of power at unpredictable times , located on remote islands so as to ensure that much of their pitiful output is lost in transmission .
What will be left of the principle of liberty , which includes the right to self - determination , when faced with Articles 6 to 19 which confuse this with personal rights and the simple power to demand a service from others ?
In my own region , the South - West of England , we have the possibility of constructing a tidal barrage across the Severn that would , with far less potential damage to the environment , have an output of two nuclear power stations and provide in a &apos; green &apos; way 5 % of Britain &apos; s energy needs .
These benefits must take into account the fact that women have less earning power and that this affects their pension entitlements .
I voted for our fellow Member &apos; s report on providing the financial assistance requested by Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria for shutting down nuclear power plants .
By creating a single strategic framework , the specific characteristics and diversity of beneficiary areas and sectors may be lost , opening the way for the EU budget to be restricted and payments from the funds to be reduced , as the major EU powers have advocated .
It should be taken into account that by creating a single strategic framework , the specific characteristics and diversity of beneficiary areas and sectors may be lost , opening the way for the EU budget to be restricted and payments from the funds to be reduced , as the major EU powers have advocated .
For six billion dollars we could have new cogeneration plants , generating both heat and power , with an output of 10 000 megawatts .
Firstly the number of them , since they account for 99 % of all businesses , then their economic power , since they employ almost 65 % of the Union &apos; s workforce .
The EBRD itself has established a series of working groups in order to clarify to what point the conditions of economic viability , environmental viability and nuclear safety are respected in the chosen option - least cost investment - to complete the Russian - designed WWER 1000 megawatt electrical power Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 reactors , to meet the safety standards approved by whoever originally conceived of these nuclear reactors .
We greatly value its contribution and its pledge , as stated in its letter of 6 October , to do everything in its power to promote the success of the Extraordinary Council Summit .
This authorization may be linked to a previous denial of access to already existing service connections , for example due to lack of power .
Through this provision , which is referred to in article 21 , paragraph 4 , they may avoid parallel service connections when there exists adequate power .
Secondly , there is no Community law and therefore no power so far as the Commission is concerned , to require the establishment or the provision of compensation .
Mr President , the casualness with which the Commission &apos; s document and Mrs Billingham &apos; s report state that the European Union must have powers covering services of general interest is questionable .
So , as human rights are an end , their application should be as far removed from realpolitik as possible , which , here , represents the area of compromise , pragmatism , concessions , the balance of power , give and take , cunning , constraints and even complicity .
When necessary , some residents do use electric lights during the daytime , but money is tight and a water bottle in the sunlight has the power of a 60 - watt bulb .
Its lead is already wide and continues to grow , while the United States has been satisfied to maintain its present number , though seeking to improve their efficiency and destructive power .
For example , to operate only an electric frying pan and a television requires power equivalent to that exerted by a team of two pulling horses !
That means an average family uses nearly as much electrical power as a horse would produce working around the clock , day in and day out , without ever stopping or getting tired .
Even when a CB is transmitting at legal power , the transmission can sometimes cause television - picture distortion in nearby sets and possibly an unwanted voice over the speaker .
Those loudspeakers closest to the speaker ’ s stand could be wired for lower power , permitting greater volume for the whole system before acoustical feedback occurs .
To achieve useful power would require firing the laser hundreds or thousands of times a minute , while pellets fall in equal numbers through the target point .
A more elaborate system of this kind has been built near Albuquerque , New Mexico , to study its economic potential for full - size power plants .
Even its fuel pump , the size of an oil drum , has power equal to 28 diesel locomotives .
It also takes hours to reach full power from a cold start .
Controversial nuclear power plants operate at a fixed capacity , resulting in wasted electricity during off - peak periods .
A watt is the unit of electrical power , the rate at which work is accomplished .
Simplified , watts express the amount of power consumed by any electrical device .
The amount of power ( watts ) used is the pressure ( voltage ) multiplied by the rate of flow ( amperes ) .
In fact , most satellites transmit with only about 5 to 12 watts of power per channel — much less than an ordinary light bulb would use .
The treatment uses deep - red laser pulses that last 40,000 millionths of a second with a power level of 100 million watts .
So often religious leaders and others , while observing these accomplishments as well as the very rapid growth of Jehovah ’ s witnesses , fail to recognize by what power this is brought about .
He added new linear motion guides to the pistons , he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder , he made the engine double - acting so it had double the power .
He showed it in Paris in 1867 , and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up .
You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space , and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications .
So you don &apos;t want to optimize for efficiency , you want to optimize for power per dollar .
So we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator , which didn &apos;t work out for us , to optimize the Stirling engine , and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar , irrespective of weight , irrespective of size , to get the most conversion of solar energy , because the sun is free .
It &apos; s just how many watts do you get per dollar , and how could you benefit from that using that power to change your life in some way .
It &apos; s currently 10 billion miles away from Earth , transmitting with that dish , with the power of 20 watts , and we &apos; re still in contact with it .
Grid computing : the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here .
And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it : as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige , or something of that sort -- worthy accomplishments perhaps , but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success .
Well , I &apos; m staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so , while I &apos; ve been speaking , you have been scanned .
WK : I made four blades , just because I want to increase power .
Not only can you use this to study what these cells do , what their power is in computing in the brain , but you can also use this to try to figure out -- well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells , if indeed they &apos; re atrophied .
These are now at a price point of -- what used to be 100,000 euros or a couple of hundred - thousand dollars -- for about 5,000 dollars , I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand .
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated .
Needless to say , this accords science a great deal of power .
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described , I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload . These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems .
What we have here , first and foremost , is an incredibly ominous mixture of power , arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union .
In reaching an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party , the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success .
For the first time since the Second World War , a party which is openly pro-Nazi , racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country .
That could convince people that Europe , in its governance , is not something run exclusively from Brussels , which concentrates and soaks up more powers , more decisions , more authority .
In this House , in the past , large - scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission , under its power of initiative , launched , not as experiments , but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress , but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union .
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few .
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union .
The protests led to the fall of dictatorial regime of General Ne Win but the army took over the power immediately afterwards and ruthlessly ended the movement .
One of the success stories of the power and reach of citizen media in Africa is definitely The Nata Village Blog .
But I still believe that those reformists are opposed by the radical members of the group who have the power and control on the group as a whole .
Some think that the advantages for a country like Costa Rica are many because Taiwan does not compare whatsoever with China in its economic power and international standing .
Raila and Ruto have decided that if they don ’ t get power , they are going to plunge the country into chaos ( but of course , they will not do the fighting ; they ’ ll get others to do it for them ) .
Many others had to leave the country . The reason is the Mujahideen warlords are still in power .
If the trial is indeed fabricated , who might have such power and resources to manipulate the law enforcement bodies ?
Or is he really trying to show the power of the people on social media sites ?
The power just doesn &apos;t like anyone talking about anything related to politics .
After the recent confusing events in Honduras , where the elected President Zelaya was demoted by the military and shipped off to Costa Rica while in his pajamas and a new President , Micheletti has taken power and declared a curfew among other measures to keep order , while citizens try to make sense of the situation , as shown on this past post .
A legal practitioner has suggested that the review of the constitution should ensure that power resides in the hands of the people through well - structured local institutions and organs and a perfected district assembly system .
Yes , rather than derogating monarchs or kings such texts in fact exalt them , for kings were to be feared because of their power , even as it is wisdom to fear God .
The true answer is recorded in the Bible : “ Jehovah ... is the Maker of the earth by his power , the One firmly establishing the productive land by his wisdom , and the One who by his understanding stretched out the heavens . ” — Jer .
The Council , however , has no real power .
I learned how the power of capitalism and imperialism was to be broken , how the nations would be united under one form of government , and how the world would become one great collective society without class distinctions or salary gaps .
The apostle Peter testified likewise : “ God anointed him with holy spirit and power , and he went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil ; because God was with him . ” — John 10 : 37 , 38 ; Acts 10 : 38 .
News &amp; World Report of December 15 states : “ Disputes over such issues as black power , the war in Vietnam and draft resistance are raising large questions about the future of the National Council of Churches . ”
In the case of true midgets , everything about them in a physical way is ‘ mini ’ — their head , their body , their limbs , their physical strength — but not their mental and emotional powers .
In addition , this extraordinary government has the power , the right , and the determination to wipe out all that is wrong .
The Chinese came to think of jade as being of supernatural origin , and hence as something that might be used to promote intercourse with heaven and propitiate the heavenly powers .
However , those with a real mission in life will want to make the best possible use of their time and their mental and physical powers .
This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
A story , a work of art , a face , a designed object -- how do we tell that something is beautiful ? And why does it matter so much to us ? Designer Richard Seymour explores our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhibit it .
This little relief on the footplate , by the way , to a rider means there &apos; s something going on underneath it -- in this case , a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably , taking the power from the engine .
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists , the poets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
Suddenly , we humans , a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature , have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .
Your knowledge is limited , health is limited , and power is therefore limited , and the cheerfulness is going to be limited .
That is our regime , our government -- our atrocious government , &#91; that &#93; has done every crime in order to stay in power .
&quot; Salman Khan talks about how and why he created the remarkable Khan Academy , a carefully structured series of educational videos offering complete curricula in math and , now , other subjects . He shows the power of interactive exercises , and calls for teachers to consider flipping the traditional classroom script -- give students video lectures to watch at home , and do &quot; &quot; homework &quot; &quot; in the classroom with the teacher available to help . &quot;
More recently , that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops , and very , very quickly , we &apos; re going to see a significant proportion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today .
Like our economic and political worlds , stories too are defined by the principle of nkali : How they are told , who tells them , when they &apos; re told , how many stories are told , are really dependent on power .
We &apos; ve surrendered our power , trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide .
If I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith , I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science , and indeed science generally , but evolution in particular , to inspire and enthrall , precisely because it is atheistic .
You can &apos;t help wondering why vote - seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of , for example , the Jewish lobby .
That is the source of many of Africa &apos; s problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector , claiming innocent lives .
And even if you look in ancient African empires , they were all organized around one particular principle -- the confederacy principle , which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority , decentralization of power .
Our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies .
Me , I have strictly no power to change anything .
Everything was done by the people to the people , and that &apos; s the power of the Internet .
It &apos; s actually strength -- it &apos; s power .
We do have alternatives , and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives , those sustainable ones , to create a greener future .
Also associated with aquaculture is a whole range of other problems , including the spread of disease and parasites to wild fish , the use of fish , fishmeal and fish oil as food with impacts on wild fish stocks , pollution of the sea floor from unconsumed food , the impact on predators when they are killed and the antibiotics used to control the disease .
The great white shark is the ocean &apos; s top predator , the lion of the seas .
What other explanation can there be for these two people attending the preliminary hearing under heavy guard and in an iron cage , as though they were dangerous predators ?
Then mobilise the other smaller states to prevent the prehistoric predators from destroying what has been built .
This annual report , though , is yet more evidence that it is not , perhaps , really a predator , but rather a toothless creature sitting in a cage .
I deplore the fact that we have to tolerate these predators operating throughout the EU subject to registration and minimum checks .
The market predators will never endlessly attack any vulnerable opening , despite the painful austerity measures taken by all Member States .
In addition , it is no doubt the case that with the removal of fish for industrial purposes the food source for other predators , such as cod , is reduced .
Or priests that have become predators to vulnerable children put at their disposal ?
This has worsened human - wildlife conflict as the weakened cows fall prey to lions and other predators .
But observing them in such profusion , one is not given the idea that they live in constant fear of the predators .
They seldom , if ever , hunt the game of the crater , except perhaps to protect their herds from predators .
The eggs and the young of fish and other sea animals are quickly gobbled up by a whole host of predators of every description .
It is only the predator man that tends to unbalance matters and that threatens to destroy entire species .
Evidently the hungry predator prefers to make a meal out of the intestines rather than the leathery , tasteless bag that is left .
Other fish emit strong flashes of light to throw predators off target or temporarily “ blind ” them .
And while enough fish are captured by the hungry predators to supply them with food , enough individuals survive to keep each species in existence .
If there were no predators that liked to eat oyster eggs or young turtles , the ocean would soon be overrun by oysters or turtles .
Siberians are among the largest land predators and , with exceptions , are pretty temperamental , harder to get acquainted with .
And the fact that Isaiah 11 : 6 - 9 and Isa 65 : 25 specifically state that former predators will be at peace with other animals , and the lion will eat straw like the bull , would seem to confirm that animals and humans were meant to be vegetation eaters .
As for the many predators being suited for the chase and the kill , what about humans ?
These provide shelter from wind and rain , as well as protection from predators .
And because their calls are usually low - pitched and can be heard only a few yards &#91; meters &#93; away , they can communicate with one another without attracting predators .
Such huge size alone is enough to discourage most predators .
Inhaling water into a special sac located in the esophagus , this homely looking fish expands into a formidable globe , covered with sharp spines that discourage any predator thinking of swallowing it .
Others are large domes of earth that provide a favorite lookout post for predators such as lions .
Some people despise the wolf because it is a predator .
Since humans have learned to live with predators such as eagles , bears , and mountain lions , there are those who are asking , “ Why not likewise live with wolves ? ”
The theory that is currently thought to be the most plausible is that preservation occurred because of a combination of “ three improbable events ” : ( 1 ) a rapid process of natural mummification ( dehydration ) , the result of the effects of the cold , the sun , and the foehn ( a warm , dry wind ) ; ( 2 ) a quick coverage by snow that hid the body from predators ; and ( 3 ) the protection from moving glaciers afforded by the depression .
For example , when there is a predator about , the avocets , the lapwings , the gulls , and the redshanks all have their own particular calls , but each call means the same thing : ‘ There ’ s a fox around ! ’
Yes , we , mankind , are earth ’ s worst predator !
With these he has ‘ misled the entire inhabited earth ’ and turned humans — earth ’ s intended custodians — into its most ruthless predators , in effect , disciples of ancient Nimrod , “ a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah . ” — Revelation 12 : 9 , 12 ; Genesis 1 : 28 ; 10 : 9 .
He promises to bring to ruin those predators who are ruining the earth .
A Toronto Star report notes that scientists have long understood that birds can take regular peeks with one eye during periods of sleep , which serves to protect them from predators .
Some brave parents cleverly feign injury to distract a predator from approaching their chicks .
Flapping on the ground as if injured , the mother will lure the predator away from the nest , only ending her act and flying to safety when the danger passes .
A zebra can sprint up to 35 miles per hour &#91; 55 kph &#93; , but it is sometimes caught off guard by predators that use surprise and stealth .
If a zebra spots an approaching predator , it sounds an alarm snort that signals the whole herd .
It is evident , though , that lions and other large predators are not in the least bit frightened by the zebra ’ s stripes .
Should the predator insist on approaching , the wildebeest will do a repeat performance .
In times of trouble , though , this antelope uses it s soaring techniques to make it difficult for a predator to trap it by the legs .
In the wild they are among the worst of the food pirates — using all methods of harassing other predators to get their kill .
The cattle do sometimes stampede if frightened , and when they eventually come to a halt , the bulls instinctively form a protective circle , with the cows and their young in the middle , safe from any possible predator .
That top predator , of course , is us .
They could outsource all their problems -- protection from predators , food finding , health maintenance .
Now , all this changes when a predator enters the scene .
There &apos; s a fourth rule : when a predator &apos; s coming , get out of the way .
Here on the model you see the predator attacking .
Now , can any of you see the predator that &apos; s about to jump out at you ?
Because she is a cub wanting to play , but she was also a predator needing to kill , and yet conflicted in some way , because she was also an emerging mother .
Here &apos; s an octopus . Sometimes they don &apos;t want to be seen when they move because predators can see them .
We &apos; ve heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project , one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects .
What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators ; it &apos; s also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column , where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found .
Is it a dangerous predator , or is it just the wind ?
Well , if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it &apos; s just the wind , you &apos; ve made an error in cognition , made a Type I error , false positive .
On the other hand , if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind , and it turns out it &apos; s a dangerous predator , you &apos; re lunch .
So the default position is just : Believe all patterns are real -- All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind .
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator ?
Well , the wind is inanimate ; the dangerous predator is an intentional agent .
Like , for example , a hive of bees that &apos; s finding a new nesting site , or a flock of birds that &apos; s evading a predator , or a flock of birds that &apos; s able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the Pacific , or a pack of wolves that &apos; s able to bring down larger prey .
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there , a by - the- wind sailor .
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish , the Mola mola , whose primary prey are jellyfish .

But then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
It protects oysters from predators and silting on the sea bottom .
Now if these mites are killed by using an insecticide , their predators will also likely be killed or driven away and will not be around to devour other more dangerous varieties that show up later .
Without doubt the greatest predator of apes is man himself .
One may wonder how any particular form of sea life can avoid extinction in the face of all its predators .
Since practically all sea animals have predators on the hunt for them , camouflage is frequently employed .
On the way he is in great danger of being caught by predators , especially birds .
If a predator comes near when the bird is on the nest , it will lay it s head on the ground so that its rounded body looks just like an anthill .
Yet even he can not run fast enough to escape his most savage predator , man .
With thousands of its natural predators being trapped , shot or poisoned by government hunters , the mule deer increased its population within 10 years to about 40,000 animals .

When it moved into it s new host , the Eastern Hemlock tree , it escaped its predators , and the new tree had no resistance to it .
It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter - illuminate itself in an anti-predation device so predators can &apos;t see its shadow , calculate its trajectory , and eat it .
We have no significant predators , we &apos; re the masters of our physical environment ; the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us .
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going , and its outcome , rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent .
With regard to the ambitious objectives and , above all , the Commission &apos; s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration , I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000 .
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions , and this is certainly true of the European Union , especially in the field of good governance and trade .
In the process of voting against , we have , of course , tried to improve the contents in the interests of the members of the nation states of Europe who might be affected , and some of the amendments which we have supported are aimed to do this .
Mr President , I welcome this procedure this year because it is the earliest start we have ever had and this will enable us , I hope , to give more serious consideration and more detailed consideration as the process develops .
In this decision it is important to avoid anything which might add to their workload and slow the process down , without allowing for the fact that the amounts involved are not vast and that if this decision for the year 2000 is adopted this year , that will not leave much time to prepare cofinancing requests .
The EU must become more efficient and more democratic , and a balance should be maintained between the small and large countries . Moreover , it is important that the Intergovernmental Conference should be concluded before the end of the year so that the process of enlargement which has been embarked upon is not delayed .
That will need very careful monitoring , a lot of cooperation between the Member State governments and as Mr van Velzen said , we as politicians have an important role to play in putting pressure on the Member States to ensure that process is achieved satisfactorily .
The underlying aim of this report , as we understand it , following on from several discussions held over a period of months , is to bring together all relevant current experiences and processes and to direct them towards a common goal , which is , by and large , to create a genuine common European diplomatic service .
This has been a problem in the long process on many occasions .
Regarding the basis of this debate , the Presidency will have the necessary elements available to enable the Heads of State and Government in Nice to have a serious discussion regarding the continuation of the enlargement process .
It is the result of the exasperatingly slow pace of the negotiating process .
With the new format , it has therefore become easier to understand and take in the whole picture , but the new activity - based budgeting must also mirror the reform process whereby the Commission establishes a simplified form of administration involving delegation and a clearer allocation of responsibility , and this is of course something more difficult to achieve .
I have on many an occasion throughout this process thought that we were lucky when we chose him to draw up the report .
But we should not forget that the Barcelona process has progressed over five years . This has happened despite all the difficulties in the Middle East .
Similarly , this democratic process can only become more credible if a national reconciliation committee is created , together with a national electoral committee to prepare and guarantee future elections , especially the elections of 10 December .
If a group would like to vote against , it has of course every right to do so , but we must also give others the opportunity to vote in favour and let the democratic process run its course .
The political process put together to recover democratic legitimacy did not fulfil the hopes that some had placed in its procedures .
Lisbon established a process to run throughout this decade aimed at turning the European economy into the most competitive , best trained , and most socially balanced economy in the world . However , we note that , at least at the end of this first year , which takes us from Lisbon to Stockholm , there are very few tangible results .
And finally , I should like to know how the Council intends to monitor and evaluate the further development of the integration process .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all , I should like to congratulate Freddy Blak on an exceptionally good report and at the same time thank him for our fruitful cooperation during this process .
I thank Parliament &apos; s staff and , in particular , my assistant , Vikki Phillips , who has made a very considerable contribution to this process over the past year .
In the process of discussions between the groups we elicited the facts , which even they had to agree .
Let us be clear : this was a choice between no information and providing information to the workforce in the process of a takeover or merger .
Although some slight progress was made during the conciliation process on protecting shareholders who do not have control of the company and on adopting some regulations on making the information of workers mandatory , the situation still fails to safeguard all aspects of workers &apos; and minority shareholders &apos; ability to take action .
Mr Maaten &apos; s proposals attempt to make that process run faster and more efficiently .
I know that Mr de Roo has instructed me in the past about how the process and the importance of it can not be overestimated , pointing for example at the way in which the Montreal Protocol has been developed into a really effective instrument from a rather poor beginning over the past decade .
Northern Ireland was lucky enough to enjoy the decisive support of US Senator Mitchell , which led to the Good Friday agreements and a genuine peace process , despite the ups and downs that it is suffering along the way .
Unfortunately , although the forum provoked some interesting debates , I , myself , took part in a debate that I found extremely interesting , the forum followed a process that was , at times , dubious and , at others , totally undemocratic .
Madam President , as someone who was born and bred in Ghent , I should first of all like to express my satisfaction at the peaceful process of the demonstrations during the European Council in Ghent .
Mr President , Mr President of the Council , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , with the constructive attitude of both branches of the budgetary authority , the European Parliament and the European Council , and with the support of the Commission , it has been possible , throughout the different phases of the complex budgetary process , to find an answer to a series of new challenges , ensure that previous commitments are fulfilled and deal with most of the priorities defined for 2002 .
There have been quite a few speakers here today who have stated that there are things in the budget process that could be done better and that the institutions should in future work better together , even though this budget has proceeded very peacefully under the expert direction of Parliament &apos; s Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg .
This is why the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should send a mission to Togo to report on respect for human rights and the smooth running of the electoral process .
We all know that Parliament &apos; s legislative power is not an end in itself : we really try to ensure , on behalf of the public , that decisions are taken openly and democratically , and that all views worthy of attention are taken into consideration during the process .
Nonetheless , we recognise that the process of debate has brought improvements , that our amendments at the first reading have introduced certain safeguards into these measures .
The Izquierdo Rojo report on women and fundamentalism , which has just been adopted by a slim majority in spite of our having voted against it , is a prime example of a good initial idea that has been completely perverted in the course of the discussion process .
On the one hand , the Fifth Euro - Mediterranean Ministerial Conference which took place in Valencia yesterday and the day before yesterday , and on the other , the current situation in the Middle East , the latest events and the efforts being made to put the peace process back on track .
It is far better to overcome outstanding problems through the enlargement process .
Lastly , during this process , will an impartial and objective analysis have been carried out of the genuine causes of the delays European flights have been experiencing ?
It is not possible to sit through this process without realising how many desirable projects for expenditure the European Union has and that , with finite resources , all budgets have to be trimmed here and there , but Members must give very particular attention to the problem of our two courts .
We all hope for a successful negotiating process , which is due to be launched at an all - ACP level within the next couple of days .
I thank Mr Prodi for presenting today the Commission &apos; s assessment of the readiness of the applicant states to join the European Union which marks those countries &apos; completion of a major assignment in that process .
We believe , however , that this can happen further down in the legislative process .
The hallmark of the Budget as we draw it up at present is that heated debates rage during the budget - setting process around every million , sometimes even every thousand euros , yet during the year we often have to shift funds around and restructure the Budget .
At its meeting in Copenhagen , the European Council will also discuss those candidate countries which are not expected to be able to conclude negotiations this year ( Bulgaria , Romania and Turkey ) , with a view to making decisions on the further course of the accession process for these countries .
The opportunity must not be missed to redress the current imbalance during this reform process .
The report highlights the extent to which the situation in the Central and Eastern European candidate countries ( CEECs ) has deteriorated during the &apos; painful readjustment process of CEECs &apos; .
Having made a thorough study of the Spanish initiatives , we have reached the conclusion that , although we are unable to subscribe to them fully , they can be accepted if some amendments are made to them that are basically designed to ensure that guarantees of the protection of citizens &apos; rights are not called into question , thereby responding to the European Parliament &apos; s main concern throughout this process .
With regard to the slow pace of the democratisation process , it should be criticised that four opposition candidates had to withdraw on the day of the presidential elections due to irregularities in the votes , even though the electoral campaign had run without any serious incidents .
And we believe it is very important at this moment - and this is the approach my group has taken throughout this debate and we believe it must continue - to try to achieve a united and decisive European position in order to ensure , essentially , that the war is not inevitable and in order to achieve a disarmament process - in relation to weapons of mass destruction , in the case of Iraq - which takes place under international pressure under the auspices of the United Nations .
First of all , globalisation is not a project , it is a movement , it is the product of the convergence of technological , economic and political processes , whose path is being mapped out more and more clearly before our eyes .
The process of having quotas for fish and throwing healthy fish overboard over the years has also contributed greatly to the position we are in .
I would add that Europe &apos; s failure , if Europe has failed - and this empty room seems to be a sign of this - is certainly , with regard to the negotiation process that preceded the commencement of hostilities , a clear failure of the intergovernmental approach .
This exceptional economic performance undoubtedly counted in Hungary &apos; s favour in the negotiations on accession , especially if we bear in mind the speed at which this country has adapted to mechanisms befitting a market economy , after forty years of central planning , and the fact that Hungary has paid the social price that this process entailed for the most disadvantaged .
We call on the Council , as a matter of urgency , to provide Parliament with early information on developments in the accession process and to involve us in good time .
Your commitment has been , and will be decisive for the future of this delicate process .
I am grateful that Commissioner de Palacio emphasised this , together with the fact that a uniform and coordinated electronic case handling system is needed , whereby cases might be monitored throughout the whole process .
Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Ferreira , on her excellent work and her excellent cooperation throughout the process of this matter .
That was why there was such universal goodwill and support for the brave steps taken by the current Prime Minister , Ranil Wickremesinghe , and the LTTE in launching a peace process to end the terrible conflict in which 65 000 people have lost their lives , many thousands have been maimed , and untold harm was inflicted on the economy and indeed the quality of life of the Sri Lankan people .
The success or failure of the constitutional negotiations will very likely determine the progress of the process of integration for the coming years as well as Europe ’ s ability to play an authoritative role on the world stage at a time of major political and economic challenges .
Starting life in January 1989 with the first Commission proposal , a proposal that was , moreover , ambitious , pursuing the objective of achieving a single market in corporate control , the progress of the takeover bids directive through the legislative process seems to have been a kind of obstacle course , with texts alternating between maximalist proposals unacceptable to some – the individual States and the Council of Ministers – and minimalist compromises unacceptable to others – the European Parliament .
During the process , one of our key objections concerned the inclusion of military operations and training .
In the process , immigrants have sometimes been stigmatised , vilified , even de - humanised .
The process of enlargement has made it possible to strengthen the new Member States ’ ability to contribute towards developing stability and security throughout the European Union , not only because they have access to the Community but also because of the improvements in the police and the judiciary that the Commission has supported during these last five years .
The basis for our opinion on the process will be the report of the OSCE Election Observation Mission .
It is those concerns , among others , that form the underlying consideration for our hope to be able to reach an agreement on Friday about a new negotiating framework on the basis of the proposals tabled by the Commission for a new way of negotiating which will offer better guarantees for the negotiating process running smoothly .
The adoption of the Constitutional Treaty by this House is an historic moment given the role played by Parliament throughout the process .
. Mr President , it is very complicated because during the whole process the structure of the report became rather complicated .
If the European Parliament makes a proposal for an amendment during the legislative process , I will of course be prepared to examine it seriously .
The environment and health strategy contained a specific focus on children and during the stakeholder consultation process to prepare the Action Plan , experts highlighted that concern .
I therefore hope that , in the course of the legislative process , we succeed in amending the directive and establishing identical threshold values for pollutants for all the Member States , so as to guarantee the same levels of toxicity for human beings and the environment .
Over the last three years , we have introduced a new currency , stabilised inflation and enacted numerous legal and administrative reforms to simplify our customs and investment processes .
But border disputes between Kyrgyzstan and its neighbours are delaying the process of frontier delimitation with Tajikistan in particular , but also with Uzbekistan .
In any event — as I also mentioned in my initial speech — the mechanisms available to us have been used and EUR 1.3 million has been allocated to ensuring that the electoral process takes place properly .
In a statement , the European Union has welcomed the satisfactory conduct of the referendum on a new Constitution in Burundi , but at the same time also urged Burundi to implement the remaining stages of the electoral process provided for in the peace accords as soon as possible .
The army has often held a crucial but ambiguous role in the running of the political process in Africa .
According to Jesuit weekly America , “ the world at large , and those of us who tried to follow the Synod ’ s process more closely shared Bishop Ndayen ’ s sentiments . ”
Thompson , who was selected to write the foreword to a centennial edition of Darwin ’ s Origin of Species had this to say : ‘ As we know , there is a great divergence of opinion among biologists , not only about the causes of evolution but even about the actual process .
In the 20th century the direction of the mine was put in the hands of an administrative council that has progressively modernized the mine , a process that continues to this day .
A cancer expert , Professor Stephan Tanneberger , stated : “ It is now an established fact that this is a process involving several stages whereby a normal cell with a certain genetic make - up is transformed into a tumour cell under the influence of several factors .
This presents a major problem for the alleged process of evolution , which involves the appearance of gradually acquired , useful characteristics .
At times , the mediation process may seem prolonged and frustrating .
So , evidently the healing process is slowly having its effect .
* During the editing process , the material was reprinted some 20 times .
In many cases one stage of the dyeing process involves the use of a mordant , which is a substance that has an attraction for both the fiber and the dye .
If feathers clearly evolved , why should discussions of the process become so vitriolic ?
We &apos; re doing it in mice first , and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this , but they will die for a good cause .
So have you come to peace with the process that happened at Ground Zero and the loss of the original , incredible design that you came up with ?
So we look at a process of group dynamics : coalescence and fragmentation , groups coming together , groups breaking apart .
We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world .
&quot; This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the &quot; &quot; dead &quot; &quot; car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process . &quot;
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative , whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market .
One of the programme &apos; s aims is to develop and supervise methods , strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision - making process and in positions of responsibility .
I am not aware of any governments who perform their legislative work in open meetings , only parliaments do that , and as legislative power is divided between parliaments and governments there are two different ways of dealing with the legislative process .
I would invite the Members of this Parliament to come up with any ideas as to how we could speed up and enhance the process .
Mr President , I will not actually speak for very long , but , so far , if I disregard the comments made by Mrs Oomen - Ruijten , only those in favour of the process have been allowed to speak .
This strategy will allow not only the whole chapter on the traditional area of the Barcelona process to be harmonised but will also allow an open methodology to be defined which will ensure , at the due time , the transition to a situation of peace , with the Middle East also being fully incorporated within this strategy . I must also highlight the report by the Secretary - General of the Council and by the Commission on the Western Balkans .
The participation of national parliaments in the institutional reform and in the conduct of European affairs should therefore be encouraged . In this way the people of each country can become involved more democratically and more directly in the process of building their Europe and in defining the Community decision - making methods .
The setting up of the Convention represented a major step towards a more democratic Europe , insofar as the process breaks with the intergovernmental approach .
You have highlighted - and I applaud you for this - all the shortcomings of the process of European integration which have hitherto come to light and the implications for Nice if the method and spirit which , sadly , have pervaded recent Intergovernmental Conferences continue to prevail .
I and many others feel that the experiment of the Convention should be repeated , and that the formula adopted should be refined as we go along , so that the hope recently expressed by President Chirac that the reform processes will increasingly serve the purpose of bringing our institutions closer to the citizens will be fulfilled .
I feel that this is a highly positive and constructive process , considering , also , that the results can be made available to the public and used to improve the quality of subsequent actions .
The Jové Peres report would not only like to regularise this situation for existing regional organisations and those that are in the process of being established , it would also like to reinforce it by putting paid to the Commission &apos; s habit of calling on the support of technical experts from different Member States .
Furthermore , access to documents must be user - friendly via the Internet or traditional methods and there will be ongoing scrutiny - extremely important - of the new process and implementation by Parliament .
Our objective was to prepare an overview of the process and decide how to take it forward from this point .
Those who are in Nice , out on the streets and in the dozens of forums and meetings scheduled will , in my opinion , at least be able to push for one result , namely that this will be the last IGC , that the hazy reflection on the future of Europe Mr Védrine spoke of will translate into the launch at Nice of a process which will establish the time frames and methods for drawing up and adopting a democratic European Constitution .
The experience of this year has convinced us that , looking beyond Nice towards the future of Europe , the process of constitutionalising the Union must not be carried out by means of the - now dysfunctional - method of negotiations between government representatives .
That method was respected and involved us in a major consultation process .
I want to say for my group that when it comes to dealing with the European Commission , when it comes to the model that has made Europe achieve what we want to see , when we look at the dual legitimacy of the European process based on a Monnet method with a strong intergovernmental input , we do not see the European Commission and their advisers as petits fonctionnaires .
But the level of this cooperation must take into account the effective progress the country may make in solving regional problems and the methods used for solving them , it s respect for human rights , and also the country &apos; s collaboration in the positive development of the Timor Lorosae independence process , particularly in solving the problems faced by the West Timor refugees and in prosecuting and sentencing militia members who have behaved criminally and only recently murdered three United Nations workers .
In the open coordination which is a feature of the Lisbon process , we have found a way of jointly pursuing the development of employment in the Union .
For the rest , we need to consider , now that nearly all the Heads of Government have said that the decision - making structures decided at Nice are poor structures , what we can do to put things right , perhaps even before the post - Nice process starts - for example in connection with enlargement agreements , which always clarified this in the past .
Nice is not only the end of a method , Nice is also the end of an era , the era of the European unification process of the 1950s , the 1960s , the 1970s and the 1980s .
Finally , the special spring European Council provides a clear opportunity for everyone to take stock of progress made and of the effective implementation of the processes and decisions which have been taken , noting any successes and any delays , through the open method of coordination .
It is also important that the open coordination process method is taken a step further .
It is tragic that each side should resort to unacceptable methods in response to the other side &apos; s resistance instead of finally sitting down at the negotiating table and beginning the process of reconstruction .
Therefore , I believe that the method we are using in the Lisbon Process is superior for this type of fundamental change in financial and political conditions .
The normal parliamentary process has been set aside , and significant parts of Parliament , including our group , have been excluded from influence .
The Verts / ALE Group believes that the issue of openness deserved a longer discussion process in which the citizens of the EU could have followed the progress of the matter better .
There are many important points which I will not have time to address now , but I would like to point out that the Committee has done a good job in deciding that the relevant strategies as well as the targets , funds and timetable should be drawn up as a framework directive , so that the matter can be handled in a democratic manner in Parliament and by the Council and so that we can enter the decision - making process and influence it .
But aside from this , the report contains some aspects , above all regarding the need to use a method similar to the Convention that drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also the need to begin a constitutional process culminating in the adoption of the European Union Constitution , which made me inclined to vote in favour of it , despite my conviction that Nice was a wasted opportunity .
It is regrettable that , in Gothenburg , the opportunity of the Summit has not been taken to reflect on the need to review the current process of integration , which is neo -liberal , federalist and militarist , including the rather undemocratic methods that have been used .
Through an informal process , it may beggar belief to Mr Bushill - Matthews - although I thank him for his original praise to begin with - that it is an employer - friendly report .
The Commission is studying potential occurrences in order to facilitate and speed up as much as possible this process of reducing cross-border charges .
The employment process based on the open coordination method has now been running for some five years , and a dramatic decline has been noticed in the level of attention given to this .
What is most significant , in my view , is our new working method , the fact that the reform of the European Union is being made into a parliamentary process .
The decisions taken in relation to the declaration on the future of Europe , in relation to the Convention method , in relation to making the common security and defence policy operative , the declarations on the Middle East peace process , Afghanistan , etc. and above all , in relation to the fight against terrorism , are going to allow the European Union to move forward and make progress .
That success will be the key to consolidating the process of gradual constitutionalisation of the Treaties we are currently engaged in , and to ensuring that such Conventions are in future perceived as a good method of preparing intergovernmental conferences .
Yet , as you are quite aware , this Convention is the product of the failure of Nice , and it s success will be measured in terms of its ability to constitute a break with the intergovernmental method of reforming the Union and to involve representatives of the people and civil society in the process of European integration .
Big business is to blame for polluting the seas with sewage , dioxins and other contaminants ; it has no compunction about using any methods in the production process which maximise its already obscene profits and is totally indifferent to the environmental implications .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like you to participate in what I believe should now be our course of action : to help , to contribute to the successful outcome of the process of dialogue which has begun between the President of the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority and the Foreign Affairs Minister , Simon Peres .
I regret that amendment since the methodologies exist for starting this process now .
The Commission therefore brought intensive pressure to bear on the Romanian Government to embark on a radical overhaul of the entire system , starting with the legislation and including the institutions , structures , procedures and decision - making channels - indeed , every aspect of the process .
Parliament thus brings open coordination into question as a method and wishes to introduce a process that abandons intergovernmental decision - making within these fundamental national areas of legislation in favour of the Community method and supranationalism , with the European Parliament as co-decision - maker .
The proposal that we are debating here today is part of the dynamic of establishing a common European asylum system based on the full and broad application of the Geneva Convention , which is intended to create a clear , more simple and workable method , for determining which State is responsible for examining an application for asylum submitted in a Member State by a third - country national in the context of an asylum process that is intended to be fair and effective .
I think Parliament &apos; s work in connection with this directive has succeeded so well as a process that it would be worth exploring and clarifying what courses of action we could adopt more frequently for the future .
Alternative processes are then required - business angels or groups of investors , private investors - bringing together people with ideas on one side and money on the other .
In addition , it provides important clarifications on the scope and methodologies used in the budgetary surveillance process at EU level : this enhances the transparency of our evaluation of Member States &apos; budget positions .
Only by wiping out capitalist profit as the ultimate purpose of the production process will we be able to stop illegal and dangerous production , processing and marketing methods .
It would set a deadline for each of the others , according to the stage reached in the process of validating an alternative , up to a maximum of five years .
Within the EU , we must sit down and go through our methods , documents and bureaucracy so that the process is made a little simpler for all those who need to use EU resources .
However , it is a step in the right direction and I believe that this modus operandi and our involvement in this process is helpful to the European Union &apos; s strategy in political and regional partnerships and the multipolar world .
Regarding the method , we must strengthen the role of the national parliaments in the drafting of national action plans ; we must give the European Parliament a role , as part of the co-decision process , on questions relating to employment under the open coordination method , and we must also involve the social partners more closely .
We must get the WTO to agree to allow us to keep certain products off the European market if they have been manufactured using processes that cause additional climate change .
In the working group of economic governors in the Convention of which I was a member , we had a majority of members who thought that the European Parliament and the European Commission should have a role to play and that the methods of open coordination and processes should be included in the Constitutional Treaty .
( FR ) In the minority opinion annexed to the Bourlanges report , I criticised , in particular , the proposal in paragraph 5 to allow the Treaties to be revised by majority vote , albeit an extremely qualified majority vote , instead of unanimously . Taking Europe further along its current path , this method would distance the Member States from the European decision - making process .
Copenhagen &apos; s success , and it s great commitment , was possible only because the Commission , and we in this House , had been supporting the process for many years , and hence we are passionate advocates of the necessity of the Community method being at the heart of the Convention &apos; s work , so that the new Europe follows the right method , not only as regards its geographical expansion , but also in core areas .
For the Commission , one of the key elements is the incentive to be given to the development of alternative methods , and the improvement of the validation process .
You know what the procedure and process for promoting foreign policy issues is at European Union level .
We must also pay tribute to the rapporteur where , in a comprehensive view of the overall economic , social and environmental impact , he calls on the Commission to promote best practice for transport reduction through the implementation of new production processes that will diminish the need for transport .
Contemptible , discreditable processes have been used to justify this aggression .
Wildlife biologists had long studied caribou by swooping down in helicopters , netting them and affixing them with radio collars , a process that some Dene saw as disrespectful to creatures they considered kin .
The development of portland cement in 1824 and subsequent invention of processes for producing reliable mild steel have added extra fields for the imagination of the architect .
Thus one of these “ professional investigators ” had his wife pose as a writer of magazine articles and go down in a zinc mine to get some information on a secret process used to get rid of diesel engine fumes .
Huge modern furnaces and an electrolytic recovery process separate the copper much faster and more efficiently than did earlier methods .
While other methods depend on aging processes that may go faster or slower under differing environmental conditions , such as changing temperature , radioactive decay rates have been shown to be unaffected by the extremes of external conditions .
This slow process , along with weekly lessons , took over three years .
This process not only allows utilization of the trees but also serves to control the spread of the infestation and generate new growth .
But more than that , we were enlightened regarding the ingenious processes that have been used to keep the colors in our clothing fixed despite frequent washing .
As we descend from our vantage point , our guide explains the ancient salt - extracting process used by the villagers .
In making it , they followed a rather simple process .
That method adhered closely to learning by rote — a memorizing process using routine or repetition .
And so we need a process of generating jobs , for ordinary young men , fast .
But that reality is expunged from our policy - making process .
Through this very simple process , we can create an astounding variety of forms .
That one is , more or less , the same type of process .
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
And it &apos; s been used since the &apos; 90s to study really complex processes .
And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models , with quantitative , as well as qualitative , methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture .
Another insight , which , again , I want to leave with you , in conditions where the problem is very large , which cuts across all economic strata , where we have a good solution , I think the process I described , you know , productivity , quality , patient - centered care , can give an answer , and there are many which fit this paradigm .
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries &apos; agriculture and fisheries , which are often harmed by the European Union &apos; s own insensitive policies , as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs , particularly for women and young people .
Nevertheless , I can not forget the numerous criticisms , both from Member States and from market operators , which , given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases , maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment , the planning of company mergers etc .
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development .
Subject : New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled : Promotion of urban , rural and coastal development , the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy .
The next item is the report ( A5-0011 / 2000 ) by Mr Langen , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener ( C5-0333 / 1999 - 1997 / 0370 ( COD ) )
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament &apos; s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point , that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community .
The next item is the report ( A5- 0010 / 2000 ) by Mrs Ahern , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE ( C5-0334 / 1999 - 1997 / 0371 ( COD ) ) .
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .
As we have heard , the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas , bearing in mind that 80 % of the population of Europe lives in cities .
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development , whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself , and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes , included in Objectives 1 and 2 , and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located .
Firstly , the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors , with the backing of the European Investment Bank .

The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water , the protection of eco systems , the promotion of the sustainable use of water , the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water .
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play , on the other hand , in the promotion of renewable energy ?
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional , renewable energy sources ?
This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity , which we have always defended , and , as such , should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans - European networks and regional policy ( through the Structural Funds ) .
The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states . A satisfactory solution can not be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned ; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion .
The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council , as Mr Hernandez Mollar said , clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based , with particular emphasis on the Union &apos; s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants .
The resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism .
Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full - time employment .
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica , the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo , the promotion of the independence of Kosovo , the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece , despite the objections of the Greek people and , at the same time , intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia .
The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research , lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation .
Lastly , the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors &apos; White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services .
We are major consumers of goods from both Israel and the occupied territories , indeed trade is probably our main political strength in the area and ensuring the promotion of the rule of law is our best political asset as we seek to contribute to the peace settlement .
Here the promotion of democracy is the first rule , combined with principles of tolerance and pluralism ; not a pluralism which is free from values , but a pluralism geared precisely towards these human rights .
They could meet on a regular basis to discuss the promotion of human rights in the short and long term .
While agreeing with some of the concrete concerns expressed in the report about , in particular , women &apos; s rights , and while approving some amendments which point the way to progress , we do not intend to support the European Union &apos; s claim that &apos; respect for , and promotion of , human rights and fundamental freedoms ... constitute fundamental objectives of EU foreign policy &apos; .
I also agree that leading the fight against racism and xenophobia and the promotion of equal opportunities should be an explicit responsibility allocated to one European Commissioner .
Economic cooperation must include multilateral / bilateral approaches facilitating the promotion of trade among Mediterranean countries and south - south trade .
Programmes financed by MEDA are in place to support industrial modernisation , structural adjustment , development of the private sector , training and promotion of small and medium - sized enterprises .

Thirdly , I think that whatever we invest in this area is neither subsidy nor promotion but sensible investment from a national economic point of view .
Clearly the development of renewables is linked to environmental objectives as well as issues of employment , regional development and the promotion of local initiatives .
I would urge support for the amendment to assist the promotion of renewables in the remote islands of the Community .
The recorded aim of the Commission with regard to the promotion of renewables obviously has to be supported .
In addition , support ought to be given to research and development projects for the promotion of renewable energy sources .
At that point , however , under the dual influence of the compromises so dear to this House and the environmentalist creed which takes off from confirmed observations into flights of utopian fancy , Mr Turmes report becomes a truly labyrinthine system , producing absolutely everything but the simple promotion of renewable energies .
I agree with all the proposed amendments which are predicated upon greater promotion of regional marketing and processing of agricultural products and which help to build up regional markets and create greater transparency , irrespective of the date on which they are introduced .
As far as the EDD Group is concerned , product traceability provides a guarantee both for the protection of consumer health and for the promotion of quality products which all producers , large or small , are capable of producing if they favour quality over base commercial and financial interests which have little regard for human health .
The instruments which we use are procedural rules , unanimity or at least broad convergence , and substantive rules , concrete harmonisation policies and the promotion of economic and social cohesion .

We should also work towards the reduction and disappearance of night flights and the promotion of the railway .
Solutions which spring to mind in this respect include a common traffic control system , stimulation of technological innovation for engines and promotion of alternative methods of transport for passengers and goods , i.e. trains for passengers and coastal navigation for goods .
At European level , the creation of the European single market and the introduction of the euro are certainly decisive factors in the promotion of electronic business .
Article 1 ( 6 ) is the only article in the directive that refers , and then only in very general terms , to the cultural area , to the protection and promotion of cultural diversity .
A big step forward is particularly visible in the areas of local administrative training , the weeding out of corruption , and the promotion of exports and agriculture .
Regulation No 2275 also provides for aid for promotion in the flower and plant sector , and this aid is also coming to an end .
An even more important point is that , following the Berlin decisions , no new money is envisaged for the promotion of new products .
Secondly , economic policy prioritises the need to develop and promote Europe as a knowledge - based society , which is why the Commission &apos; s preliminary draft budget has set a very large plus against research and a new edition of the programme to promote small - and medium - sized enterprises and , more importantly , contains a proposal to combine them with the promotion of technology , which was also a matter of concern to the rapporteur , Mrs Haug .
I would also like to highlight , as a fundamental contribution to the consolidation of the progress made until now , the promotion and maintenance of rigorous regulations on health and safety at work , which has been one of the most prominent issues in the debate held in the Commission , which advocates better jobs in Europe .
I should like to remind the House that the European Council in Lisbon highlighted the promotion of social inclusion and called on the Commission , and the Council , to take priority actions for specific target groups .
With regard to the promotion of equal opportunities in the context of policies on cooperation with development , I would like to point out that , in my view , efforts in this area should concentrate especially on guaranteeing girls &apos; access to primary education , which means at the same time ensuring that it is free .
Otherwise , MEDIA PLUS focuses on the promotion and distribution of European films , particularly in cinemas .
Fortunately , there are also examples of how things can be done , for example , the Stability Pact , which is a mixture of economic reconstruction , promotion of human rights and the development of a civil society .

Relations between the European Union and NATO are converging so quickly that the non-aligned countries are in a very precarious situation , although they want to make a full contribution to the promotion of national security .
This will should be shown through three essential aspects : firstly the defence of the major European causes of peace , freedom and economic and social development which must underlie the negotiations with the applicant countries ; secondly the promotion of the merit of each country as the only condition to be imposed on accession , and thirdly the maintenance of the economic and social cohesion of the current 15 Member States .
Mr President , as has been pointed out , the influence of the European Union in Latin America is important from an economic and commercial point of view , but also from a political point of view , and this is characterised by our encouraging a type of relationship which favours egalitarian treatment - cooperation and the promotion of democracy - and this is completely opposed and different to that which has for centuries originated from Big Brother , in the north of the continent .
I would draw the Commissioner &apos; s attention to the need for greater coordination of European funds with the objectives of sustainable development within the EU and real balance between the regions . These objectives require the promotion , as already mentioned , of alternative means of transport such as the railways , the sea and cabotage which will reduce congestion on the roads and stimulate the ports .
Borin : At first , my blog is not about Cambodia , it was about web hosting , design , and website promotion .
This week , we will be doing our first paid promotion for an online video competition organized by the website Put it On .

With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED for its outstanding humanism , the scope of its principles , for its open and generous promotion of young values .
At a macro level , he thought , you know , we talk about democracy promotion , but we do it in a way sometimes that &apos; s an affront to people &apos; s dignity .
Merit must be recognised and rewarded , specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade .
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee , in particular , our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you , Commissioner , accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct , particularly when considering appointments and promotion .
Parliament and its members must ensure that there is no place for this sort of thing in our House and that we keep our employees motivated by ensuring that they can be certain that promotions and recruitments are made on the basis of merit and qualification , not cronyism .
Since the present Commission took office , six appointments have been made involving promotions to grade A1 .
In the same period 19 appointments involving promotion to grade A2 have been made .
In summary therefore , a total of 25 promotions to senior appointments have been made since this Commission took office . Six of the officials are Italian nationals , five are German , five are British , three Belgian , two Irish , one Dutch , one French , one Austrian and one Spanish .
So in legal , procedural and employment policy terms , the use of the panel system for promotion and appointment purposes was not required by the existing law in the case of appointments of that kind .
It is significant that the island country , the larger island country , secured in the course of these months under this Commission no additional appointments at A1 level by promotion .

I would like to say to Mrs Dybkjær that in the comprehensive pursuit of our policy for equal opportunities , there will be evidence as the coming months and years pass , of us giving attention from the point of the invitation to applications , right through to initial appointment and promotions , to show that we are making serious efforts to secure substantial advances in the number of women of all ages and all grades who are employed in the Commission .
And we must also solve the problem of promotion in the autumn in a way which is acceptable to all institutions .
We need to propose to the Member States that all judges should gradually be trained and that this should be the sine qua non for the promotion of older judges to more senior positions and for the admission of newcomers to the bench .

It is setting them goals , it is identifying the need for training for development , for promotion and identifying the things that they need to do to contribute to the development of themselves and to the organisation overall .
Moreover , it is precisely the electorate that has a lot of difficulty understanding why the EU &apos; s institutions maintain such a rigid and old - fashioned personnel policy in which promotions are made on the basis of very formal criteria rather than on the basis of effort .
In that connection , I should like , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , to support the Commission &apos; s proposal for the linear career structure which has been mentioned quite a few times this evening and in which promotions are made on the basis of ability and effort .
So far as employment rights are concerned , rights of assessment and promotion , rights of appointment to management , there is no barrier and no hierarchy has expressed any direct or indirect desire to install such a barrier .
Even more fundamentally , this runs in direct contradiction to the emphasis that the Committee on Budgets has put in this report , on the staff appointment or promotion always being based on ability and merit .
For example , we could set ourselves the objective of halving the current differential between men and women on pay , training , pensions and promotions and the length of time women stay in work by 2010 .
We are making sure that whilst there will be upgradings in line with the promotion aspects of the service commitments , we will not be allowing the fast - tracking that was destined to lead to this enormous extra cost in the coming year or two .
Madam President , I too should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur , Mrs Ghilardotti , on her enormous contribution to the promotion and highlighting of the relatively new concept of gender budgeting .
Women continue to experience discrimination and we know all too well – including in politics and in this institution – the glass ceiling which can operate in so many ways as regards possibilities of access , promotion and playing a full role .
Violence against women , trafficking in human beings , unemployment , incompatibility between professional and private life , inadequate care facilities for children and the elderly , inequalities in pay and promotion are burning issues which urgently need to be resolved , in that they relate directly both to the infringement of rights and to the sustainability and competitiveness of the economy .
This Parliament sets great store not only by the protection of fundamental rights , but also by their promotion .

Improvements should be brought in to speed up recruitment procedures to fill the 750 unoccupied posts within the European Parliament ’ s administration and to create a truly merit - based promotion system .
If we remember our core principles of the promotion of democracy , human rights , freedom from torture and above all of dialogue , then we will speak with a loud and clear voice .
( PL ) Madam President , the promotion of human rights is the main pillar of the European Union &apos; s external policy .
Fifty directors -general with a princely EUR 17 000 per month for an initial 30 employees , 73 promotions to the position of director - we could easily get the impression that this is a self - service shop .
We advocate industries that are efficient in terms of using resources that are less dependent on carbon , that value jobs with rights , and that guarantee equal rights for women in terms of access to jobs , to promotion , to wages , and to participation in management and administrative bodies .

Is the Commission aware that since Colleges of Education in the UK were taken out of the control of Local Authorities in April 1993 , those thousands of lecturers who remained on their transferred terms and conditions of service have been denied pay increases , promotion and staff development opportunities , and have also been made more vulnerable to dismissal or redundancy ?
In addition to seeking to correct this process , the measures and amendments are positive because they are transitional measures and do not adversely affect formal equality , since they are only intended to correct inequalities in the sphere of appointment , promotion and development , and the preference is of a temporary nature .
Speaking on my own behalf , and aware of the fact that I am going against the current of current trends , I must nevertheless say that I do not feel it possible to support amendments 5 , 12 , 13 and 14 , which pose a true problem of political philosophy , as they establish an inequality of right in the recruitment and promotion of Community officials .
Mr President , I am particularly pleased that you are prepared to place your hand on your heart and to concede that in the European institutions , including the European Parliament , there are far too few women in senior posts . And because you have stated that so clearly I assume that over the next two and a half years you will , among other things , take the opportunity to make drastic changes to Parliament &apos; s recruitment and promotion procedures , in order that women , too , can be afforded the chance to make a career .
The directive must be applied in matters of recruitment , promotion , remuneration and social security .
At the management level , grade A2 , the Commission saw it s female staff double in 1996 , since it numbers to date fifteen female managers , as a result of the seven appointments / promotions which took place during the year .

I took my job as junior clerk seriously and set my sights on promotion .
If respect is shown , promotion at the secular workplace will not be based on gender but on ability and experience .
Robbed of prospects for promotion , they start to job hop .
Maria , a Brazilian office worker , put it this way : “ A person may have ability , but circumstances , and maybe even favoritism , can hinder promotion . ” — Compare Ecclesiastes 2 : 21 ; 10 : 6 .
“ A person may have ability , but circumstances , and maybe even favoritism , can hinder promotion ”
Christianity is to be lived for what it is , not for rewards and promotions .
For him there was never promotion , except in an inverse sense , downward , step by step .
So instead of looking back at the old - world system and the temporary advantages or promotions that it offers , they look ahead to the blessings of the new world and keep their eye on the Kingdom goal , putting forth every effort to advance the Kingdom interests by ministerial activity .
Promotion and high position in secular activity are frequently sacrificed in behalf of the preaching work .
Finally , it is recommended that we reach out for privileges of service in Jehovah ’ s organization , rather than promotions in Satan ’ s organization .
If we do believe what John wrote , then why look for more promotions in a dying world ?
Reach out for greater privileges in Jehovah ’ s organization rather than promotions in Satan ’ s organization .
This possibility made his heart rejoice , so that neither a recent job promotion nor discouragement from relatives could hold him back .
Viewing oneself as working “ as to Jehovah ” is a powerful motivation to be productive , far more so than a pay raise or the lure of a promotion .
He turned down an offer for promotion and resigned from his secular work .
Although he stopped working for promotion , it came his way . — Proverbs 22 : 29 .
Boy , it matters a lot because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side , not at the table , and no one gets the promotion if they don &apos;t think they deserve their success , or they don &apos;t even understand their own success .
We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues , we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A , to reach for the promotion , to sit at the table , and we have to do it in a world where , for them , there are sacrifices they will make for that , even though for their brothers , there are not .
&quot; And literally from that moment , she doesn &apos;t raise her hand anymore , she doesn &apos;t look for a promotion , she doesn &apos;t take on the new project , she doesn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Me . I want to do that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
And if two years ago you didn &apos;t take a promotion and some guy next to you did , if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities , you &apos; re going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal .
From field studies to laboratory studies , we see that winning or losing an election , gaining or losing a romantic partner , getting or not getting a promotion , passing or not passing a college test , on and on , have far less impact , less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have .
The kind of mind -- part of the mind -- when you &apos; re reaching for that piece of chocolate , when you want to win that promotion at work .
But if no account is taken of the fact that each class contains at least one pupil who knows more than the teacher , then the initiative can not but fail .
It has been an excellent signal from the EU to the heart of the people for decades now , and we have been able to get it across via children , school pupils , schools and homes .
Furthermore , a scheme with subsidies per pupil would be much easier to administer .
There are various traditions relating to which dairy products are consumed , and the scheme is simplified by awarding the subsidy on the basis of a quarter of a litre of milk per pupil per school - day .
In many schools around Europe , milk is provided free of charge to the pupils in order to meet their need for different forms of nutrition .
Since the 1950s , Swedish schools have provided pupils with milk and school dinners .
Today , the concern is certainly not to wait for pupils to fail , at the end of their schooling , before showing some imagination .
One goal must be to enable pupils constantly to update their knowledge and skills so that they are neither able nor willing to view a diploma or certificate as the end of a learning process or as a seal of approval upon something finally completed .
It is clear , furthermore , that while lifelong training must become a reality , nonetheless even at the stage of basic education , in what Mr Seppänen called general education , it must be taken into account in order to ensure that every school pupil is motivated and has the necessary skills to learn in the various situations he will find himself in as an adult .
Subject : Health and safety warnings relating to the private use of visual display units Further to my exchange of letters on this issue with Commissioner Byrne , can the Commission give a firm commitment that it will further examine whether a Directive is required to provide health and safety advice to parents and teachers whose children / pupils use computer equipment either at home or at school ?
As far as advice to be given to parents and teachers , whose children and pupils use computers , is concerned , manufacturers are obliged , under the present legislation to provide an instruction for safe use of the equipment if deemed necessary .
Another aspect which was close to my heart is that parents , pupils and teachers too should be involved in the process .
The report points out , for example , that comprehensive and high school education has not paid adequate attention to cooperation between pupils , their parents and the organisers of education .
The importance of including pupils and their home background in decision making is certainly worth bearing in mind .
I am glad to see that we are recognising the importance of involving pupils themselves in the development and assessment of our educational system .
Evaluation also aspires to becoming a lever which can be used to force schools to operate in a competitive environment in which the best schools attract the best pupils , the best teachers and the most funding - in other words to operate on market criteria .
In addition , the system of self - evaluation shifts the government &apos; s responsibility for the quality of education on to teachers , pupils and parents .
I also fully agree with better integration between parents , pupils and teachers and the many community players who rightly want to play a role in education and its development and achieve , as a result , the idea of the school as the community .
We can not afford ourselves the luxury of 20 % , at the very least , of pupils being left by the wayside because they have not received the education they need to be able to do well in society .
Education and training in all professions involved in protecting , preserving and promoting cultural and natural heritage are also important , as are raising pupils &apos; and young people &apos; s awareness and developing a movement of voluntary activities which can also make a decisive contribution .
Access to the Internet , to multimedia resources , will be made available in many public centres , including centres in disadvantaged areas , by the end of 2001 and to all school pupils by the end of 2002 .
Mr President , I think that Mrs Redondo expressed it very well in her speech and that , indeed , in this BSE crisis there are Member States who are advantaged pupils , who prepare for the examinations months in advance , and others , such as ours , the government of my country , who are at the bottom of the class , prepare for the examinations five minutes before and when they fail , blame the teacher .
Madam President , as an explanation of the EU &apos; s serious reprimand to Ireland , Mr Prodi expressed the opinion that we must also be able to punish the best pupil in the class .
It would be more natural to hold the best pupil in the class up as a model . That was how it was when I was at school .
When the President of the Commission said that sometimes , the schoolmaster must punish even the best pupil , he revealed a stunningly original perception of the new European method of governing .
I have discovered , by means of a communication to the three European schools - and the Members of this House well know that the European schools are highly active when it comes to approving the budget - that on 7 March a debate will be held with the pupils of the European School , section III , in which the President - in - Office of the Council and Swedish Prime Minister , Mr Persson , the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , and the Prime Minister of the Belgian Federal Government , Mr Verhofstadt , will participate .
Madam President , I believe that this requires an explanation from you and that you should also approach the very august members of the Council to tell them that , if they want to speak with civil society - in this case the pupils of the school - they must take account of the Parliaments , as they emphasised in the fourth Annex .
To date we have received a few , still only very sketchy details , including the fact that this will take place in a school with the pupils involved .
With regard to your comment on teachers and pupils , there was a brilliant Neapolitan man of the theatre - he was Neapolitan but also Italian and European - who used to say that you can never say you have taken your last exam .
If we are to begin this discussion at the right end , we should , just like the school pupils in Brussels and the contributions on the website , ask the fundamental questions of what tasks we want the Union to take on and what role we want the Union to play in Europe and globally .
At the Stockholm Summit , we shall need to start systematically monitoring electronic learning , bringing together indicators to control equal access of pupils and non-pupils to information and communications technologies and taking measures to combat geographical , social and cultural inequalities .
As far as special education and training are concerned , apart from a few generally positive but non-binding proposals relating mainly to tertiary education , the text is based on the unscientific approach of placing pupils with disabilities in mainstream schools , ostensibly with a view to integrating them into society as a whole .
There is a risk of inequality between countries , between regions , between social groups , between minors and adults , between men and women , between pupils and parents and between private and state schools .
Six : we need a humane model which is not based on information overload and which can be combined with pupils &apos; need for free time , with cultivating the imagination , with creativity in all sectors and with developing social conduct in school .
Not technologies that individualise , isolate and alienate pupils .
Firstly : in education more attention should undoubtedly be paid to training in information technology both for pupils and for teachers .
My group , the ELDR , attaches great importance to the e-Learning project for both pupils and teachers .
It is said that in Flanders there is a computer for one pupil in every ten .
Kinghorn primary school in Fife thought that the research issue was important and that an e-mail network of pupils allowing them to discuss and explore the issues was critical .
It is important that UNWRA is running a substantial tolerance and awareness programme in its schools to counteract any negative influence on the pupils , but it can not be very easy for a teacher in the camps to be teaching children about tolerance and awareness when they go out of the camp in the evening and see tanks and guns and stone throwing .
There were no mergers in Pueblo when all twelve Catholic schools closed and over 2,600 pupils were expected to turn to the public system .
When asked these questions , a Danish pupil replied : “ A good teacher really knows the subject or skill .
So , in addition to favoring short words and short sentences , be sure to explain any word that may represent the unknown to your pupil .
This is not because teachers fail to instruct pupils concerning respect for authority .
&#91; There is a &#93; constant need for disciplining aggressive pupils , which in some schools takes from 50 % to 75 % of a teacher ’ s time . ”
But , the pupil wonders , “ Did it ? ”
According to one study , 200,000 New York city pupils are affected by overcrowding in schools ; 40,000 have makeshift classroom accommodations .
Primitive though Haüy ’ s system might have been , pupils of his school acquired their education by this method for more than forty years .
Obviously the girl suffered from school fatigue , an “ ailment ” that is spreading among pupils in modern society .
However , many surveys point to one basic underlying cause — pupils experiencing school fatigue lack motivation for studying .
We must then , instead , give schoolwork a goal and a purpose in order to get the pupils to accomplish something . ”
Many fatigued pupils can be helped by being given incentive .
Instruction that includes information that may not be in harmony with the Bible , but that does not require a pupil to disown his faith or to take part in an act of false worship , can still be useful .
This creates better understanding among all parties involved — teacher , pupil and parents .
Feeling that the parents care about their child , the teacher may be moved to take a greater personal interest in him as a pupil .
Even the Teachers ’ Annotated Edition of our textbook Living in the Old World suggested having the pupils read the story of Nebuchadnezzar and his dream from Daniel , chapter 2 , concerning the rise and fall of world powers .
No teacher can work miracles , nor will years of training make a good dancer of an untalented pupil .
I have never prided myself on having an unusually gifted pupil .
Consider the influence on a 16 - year - old pupil when a teacher in her 20 ’ s sits on his desk and asks : “ How come you haven ’ t been by to see me like the other boys in this class ? ”
She enjoys dancing and even took part , along with the other pupils , in a public ballet given at the end of the school year .
In one school the ratio is one teacher for every two pupils .
Yet , by endless practice and repetition the little boy , like millions of other young pupils in China , is being taught , in perhaps the only practical way , the rudiments of written Chinese .
One day at school I gathered all my pupils , mostly high school students .
In addition , he is an instructor of art classes in oil painting in Vancouver , where he teaches 15 to 25 pupils each Saturday .
School authorities report that pupils are stabbing one another , youngsters have been thrown over balconies and even through plate - glass windows .
First of all , we wanted small schools -- about 300 , 400 pupils -- 14 to 19 year - olds , and critically , about 80 percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms , but through real - life , practical projects , working on commission to businesses , NGO &apos; s and others .
That every pupil would have a coach , as well as teachers , who would have timetables much more like a work environment in a business .
And all at no extra cost , no selection , and allowing the pupils the route into university , even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs and have manual jobs as well .
And perhaps most important of all , two years later when the exam results came through , the pupils who had been put on these field trials who were in the lowest performing groups had jumped right to the top -- in fact , pretty much at the top decile of performance in terms of GCSE &apos; s , which is the British marking system .
We test his eyes to see if he has square pupils for squaring the accounts . Then we carry out a blood test to see if he has a high resistance to alcohol because , in some governmental circles , a toast is drunk every time a pensioner dies .
After taking the drugs , I would be drawn to a mirror where I peered for long periods of time into the pupils of my eyes .
Under the influence of the drugs , the pupils would increase in size to almost the size of the iris .
Watch that little fellow , his pupils widen , his eyes glaze with inward - turning thought .
Behind the cornea is the colored iris , with a hole , or pupil , at its center .
The iris automatically increases or decreases the size of the pupil to control the amount of light entering the eye .
He literally “ lights up ” the inside of your eyeball and looks into it through the pupil and lens .
The iris has a hole at its center , known as the pupil .
Therefore the doctor can prescribe drops that will enlarge the pupil .
Then the cornea can be folded down , giving access through the pupil to the lens .
One researcher found that the sight of the mother ’ s face caused the greatest dilation of the pupils even in infants less than one month old .
By means of two pupils , he can see above water through the short dimension of the lens and under water through the long dimension of the lens .
To keep the upper pupils moist , he ducks his head under water every few minutes .
But the wide - open pupil is only one means the cat uses to see in dim light .
When the fish swims along the surface of the water to hunt for food , it keeps it s eyeballs halfway above the water , using one pupil to scan the world above and the other to see below the surface — doubling the chances for a meal , or an escape .
( 4 ) The pupil is a black dot cut from a sheet of polyvinyl chloride with an instrument similar to a paper punch .
The size is determined by the patient ’ s age and by how the real pupil reacts to light .
Light enters your eye through the pupil , that dark opening in the center of the iris .
But what if some condition blocks the pupil , the meshwork , or the canal ?
In eyes that have a shallow anterior chamber and a narrow angle between the cornea and the iris , the enlarged lenses gradually move forward to block the aqueous flow through the pupil .
One day I heard a painter confide to a friend that he has to rest me firmly against the bench and take a deep breath and hold it until the extremely fine strokes of the eyes , pupils , and brows are all completed .
“ Each was in a prized shade of chocolate , bisected by the characteristic light streak resembling a cat ’ s slit pupil , ” reports Asiaweek .
In the bright glare on the ice , their pupils contract to a vertical slit , allowing them to see comfortably there too .
For example , the pupil can expand from 0.06 inch to 0.3 inch ( 1.5 mm to 8 mm ) in diameter , resulting in a possible 30 - fold increase in the amount of light entering the eye .
Evidently , therefore , the thought conveyed is much like that expressed at Proverbs 7 : 2 , 3 : “ Keep my commandments and continue living , and my law like the pupil of your eyes .
The right picture in the mind of the composing psalmist is that which is suggested in Psalm 17 : 8 , where David prays to the Most High : “ Keep me as the pupil of the eyeball , in the shadow of your wings may you conceal me . ”
Scientists tell us that every second ten trillion particles of light pass through the pupils of our eyes .
Some situations , yes -- high stakes , maybe their pupils dilate , their pitch goes up , their body movements change a little bit , but not all the time , not for everybody , it &apos; s not reliable .
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts , so opacities of the lens .
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure ?
We are as displeased by the second period of management by the Bank , starting in the last quarter of 1999 , as we were satisfied with the first , not because the Bank overestimates the importance of variations in exchange rates against the dollar - it does in our view , but that is by the by - but because the debate on exchange rates obviously masks the Central Bank &apos; s aversion to growth and its serious underestimation of the potential rate of growth of the European Union .
I will shortly present a report to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation in the Member States of the Community legislation on the protection of animals during the last quarter of this year .

And in the majority of cases , the mandates for negotiation that have been planned are contingent on the agreement being concluded , as in the flagrant example of Gabon , an agreement which expires on 30 March and whose mandate for negotiation is planned for the fourth quarter of the year .
This is a year when the present Commission was only able to influence the final quarter of the year and so can not be held responsible for a very great deal .

Overall , statistically , Eurostat has estimated that of the 0.8 % rise in inflation recorded in the first quarter of this year , between 0 and 0.16 % could be attributed to the cash changeover .
The prospect of actually successfully solving the problem of mass unemployment in the coming fourth quarter is made fainter by mounting indirect labour costs and the failure of the European Union , among others , to solve the problems caused by distortions of competition .
In reply to question E- 1265 / 02 of 26 April 2002 by the author of the present question , the Commission stated that it would issue a communication on the Third Road Safety Action Plan during the third quarter of 2002 .

Growth rates for the last quarter of 2002 range between 0.1 % and 0.4 % of GDP growth within the European Union .
The EU &apos; s share of the shipbuilding market fell from 19 % , in 2000 , to 10 % in the first quarter of 2002 , resulting in the closure of several European shipyards , unemployment and ever - present threats of further cuts , as I saw on a visit to the shipyards at Viana do Castelo .
For the record , the Human Rights Association has found that 183 people were subjected to torture , ill - treatment and detention in Turkey in the first quarter of this year alone .
In the first quarter of this year , Spain reported about 50 % more BSE cases than during the corresponding period last year .
Some Member States are thus officially in recession , and that means that the economy has contracted for the second consecutive quarter .
Of key importance in the acceptance of the outcome of conciliation was the undertaking by the Commission to put forward a proposal on the third pillar of the Aarhus Convention during the first quarter of 2003 , which is to say by the end of March this year .
The Commission has still not adopted the proposal for a Directive on access to justice in environmental matters , even though the last quarter of the year is already upon us , which means the proposal is six months late .
We are nonetheless still concerned about the implementation of this budget line in recent years and therefore want again to call upon the Commission to report each quarter to Parliament &apos; s relevant committee on the implementation of the programme in the current year and on the planning for next year .
We therefore need to concentrate on those proposals that absolutely must be adopted by the end of the parliamentary term , that is to say during the first quarter of 2004 , and monitor progress on those that we are patiently waiting to scrutinise for the first time .
At the latest ministerial troika meeting of the EU- Africa Dialogue , held in Rome on 10 November , which I attended together with the Irish Foreign Minister , it was agreed that discussions and the corresponding report of the issue of Africa &apos; s External Debt should be prepared as a matter of priority and that the experts meeting within the enlarged Troika should be held in the first quarter of next year .

The contribution of energy to the increase in the price index in the fourth quarter of 2007 averaged 0.8 % in the euro area .
However , in this case it has not been based on averages but on the period between late 2007 and early 2008 , when the situation engendered by the disputes with Mauritania , due to the use of certain technical measures , led to a large part of the European fleet being reluctant to conclude this Agreement , due to the fear of boarding , as happened in the first quarter of 2008 .

When I hear the head of Citigroup , which has once again made a profit , and when I hear Mr Ackermann from Deutsche Bank , which has once again made a profit in the first quarter , I wonder whether these people believe that they can just go on as before , now that they have been bailed out by the state .

I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society .
In my capacity as a representative of the Commission , I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe &apos; s common heritage .
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union .
If the establishment of such an area , in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens , is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats , while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake , then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens .
Mr President , I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out , or remind , the representative of the Commission that , in Belgium , the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence , right to be reunited with their families , etc .
Representatives of the Council , within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament .
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference .
However , today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union &apos; s democratic role .
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics , and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community , insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives , are grave and also inappropriate .
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament .
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel , you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who , as I understand it , was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party &apos; s summit meeting .
In light of what I have said , I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you , so that on 14 February , the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos , can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament &apos; s backing .
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States , especially Britain and France , seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty .
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments , which were represented by competent and exacting delegations .
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and , therefore , not only within the working party , but also at the same political level as the Commission .
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission .
Commissioner Barnier , I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values : make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles , because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe .
Parliament &apos; s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that , with the Union &apos; s institutional changes , we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union .
The Commission &apos; s current President , Mr Prodi , and the High Representative , Mr Solana , have put forward ideas along the same lines .
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings , I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me , on the basis of our shared experience , in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives , Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok , are going to be working .
And once again I should like to point out in this House , in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam , that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament , prior to Amsterdam , the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations .
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and , as far as I am concerned , in my current position , I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations .
In the coming months , ladies and gentlemen of the House , the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation , on good terms , with your two representatives , Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok , in order to reconcile our points of view , if need be .
Firstly , to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano , the chairman , and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate .

This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking , with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes . It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions .
Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party and European Democrats , I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa , an elected representative of the Basque people , and Jorge Díez , a member of the Basque police force . We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party .
I feel that it was right for the two highest representatives of Parliament and the Commission to tackle the most sensitive issues of the peace process which , as we are aware , is still running into difficulties .

The implication of this is that the United Kingdom and France should give up their seats in the Security Council and make way for an EU representative .
One example is the social dialogue . Social dialogue is not so much a matter of establishing and recognising social partners , but mainly a problem of culture , of familiarity with employers &apos; delegates and employees &apos; representatives , of experience with providing information , consulting , debating and negotiating .
It is also true , however , that we must as a Presidency take account of the fact that the Member States have so far indicated that they are not yet ready to discuss a constitution , even if an illustrious list of political representatives has raised the issue .
My last point is that , when it comes to drafting the Constitution for real , the key point will be to determine wherein the legitimacy of the European authority lies , and , in our opinion , it must come from the peoples , from our citizens and their representatives , the European Parliament and perhaps the national parliaments .
I am entitled to say that I am the only representative of a party which is only present at the European Parliament .

First , the international organisations that carry out these operations , such as UNMIK in Kosovo or the office of the High Representative in Sarajevo , also need to benefit from this aid .
You , the representatives of the European Parliament , who directly represent the citizens of its member countries , the citizens of Europe , are best placed to understand why the very possibility of entry into Europe seems extremely uncertain to us , the citizens of the present - day Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
&quot; Instead of what is suggested by the words &quot; &quot; of producers and artists , especially from the non profit - making sector &quot; &quot; , my primary intention was that we should include in this circle representatives of content providers . &quot;
In fact , the municipal and social representatives of those citizens are with us today .
Other criticism concerned the High Representative &apos; s Office and how the European Union works with that office .

In this regard , I would emphasise the concerns expressed by representatives at the highest level of various Latin American countries at the meeting held on this issue in Rio de Janeiro , in the middle of last year .
We expect this to be understood not just as the job of the Council and the High Representative of the CFSP ; we also expect an important , creative initiative on the part of the Commission .

I read a report in the press about an unacceptable pre-election intervention by the High Representative of the CFSP , Mr Solana , in connection with Moldavia ; taking account of the results of the election - in which the people of Moldavia voted freely and gave a huge majority to the Communists - I wished to raise the question of this unacceptable stand .
You can not build a citizens &apos; Europe and yet bypass the elected representatives of the people , namely us parliamentarians .
Mr President , Mr President - in - Office of the Council , I have listened to you very carefully , but I believe many MEPs and many European citizens have been left with a bad taste in our mouths in view of the results of the last summit , held in Nice , where the Charter of Human Rights was not approved , and I do not know why the representatives of the Member States &apos; governments did not want to approve it .

We therefore believe that , at the Fourth Summit in Copenhagen , parliaments , both European and Asian , must play an ever more important role as representatives of popular sovereignty .
However , this objective can not be achieved without a suitable , operational tool . And this tool is none other than a well organised external diplomatic service , with specialised and highly trained cadres to man the Union &apos; s delegations or embassies so that , by operating within an institutionalised regulatory framework of relations with the European Parliament and the Council , they can develop into real representatives of Union policy and interests and of the interests of the Member States as a whole .
Parliament must take greater pride in being the representative of a democratic institution which will soon include half a billion people , at precisely a time when such a large proportion of the public is critical of globalisation .

Mr President , Mr President - in- Office , Commissioner Patten , I should firstly like to express my satisfaction and also congratulate the High Representative of the CFSP and Commissioner Patten , because I think that in our attempts to resolve this conflict we are actually revealing the form which our CFSP will take .

LGBT community representatives demanded that authorities prosecute the violence as a hate crime .

Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen -- not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special -- it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization - state .

&quot; So I said to my assistant , &quot; &quot; Invite the other women permanent representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I share the Commissioner &apos; s view that the reproach made by Addis Ababa is misplaced to say the least . Misplaced because this statement is made by a government which has been embroiled in an absurd war over borders with its neighbour , Eritrea , for two years now .
This is not a reproach to the Commission but an observation , and one which will , of course , create even more bad feeling , bearing in mind that another EUR 5.5 billion is still to be found .

Yesterday we spoke in this Chamber about a European Party Statute . You were not able to be present , and I do not intend that as a reproach .
The report that has been submitted to us is not entirely free from reproach in this respect , and nor , what is more , is the Commission &apos; s communication .
This is not intended as a reproach , it is simply a statement of fact .
This is not a reproach directed at the Commission .
Now to the reproach under point 16 , where it says that the Commission wants to exclude Parliament from the process of Community participation in the various regional fisheries organisations .
I have yet to see an internal market topic which has caused so much misinformation , emotions and bitter reproaches to be exchanged .
It also demonstrates that some understanding for the Turkish situation , some balance rather than a constant barrage of politically motivated reproach , is more likely to lead to improvement in those areas where we have justified criticisms .
But the complaints and reproaches which Mr García - Margallo y Marfil directs at the Commission should be addressed to the Member States , since it is with them that the problem lies .
However , this familiar European reproach addressed to Washington is rooted in a fundamental weakness on our side .
Mr President , as this is the first time you have been in this situation , my reproach is not directed at you ; in recent years , though , I have known many Vice - Presidents of this House who said in discussions of this sort on the issue of Question Time that they would endeavour to ensure that it did not happen again and that it was an exception .
Consequently , if any reproaches are to be made on these matters , they should be fair ones .
Thanks to Mr Caudron and the rapporteurs on the specific programmes , we have worked efficiently and we now have plenty of time for our scientists to prepare , knowing our aim is to make the sixth framework programme efficient , well managed , easy to take part in and above reproach from the financial point of view .
This is a reproach directed at the Member States and also at the Commission .
The reproach made against the United States that America may not be the policeman of the world actually sounds comical coming from the mouths of those who are by no means in a position to be so themselves and for that matter are often not prepared to be so .
It is intellectually unfair to systematically fling the reproach of racism and xenophobia in the face of politicians who believe that our densely populated societies can no longer deal with fresh waves of immigration without catastrophic social effects .
I should like to say that after everything that has happened , we would do well to look ahead instead of heaping reproaches on one another .
Major frustration even led to the reproach that the international community and the EU were taking sides .
Today , the economic interests that I encounter in the Congo are Chinese , Indian , Israeli , American . This is not a reproach , not a critique , but I find few , very few European economic interests , Mr Pflüger .

No - one should play silly games with health and safety and I should say , without fear of reproach , that this report is one of the most important directives made in health and safety .

Even then , refusal to serve was known to be the normal policy of the Christians — as the reproaches of Celsus ( 177 - 180 A.D. ) testify ....

Jehovah ’ s angel told Daniel of the result of the deliverance furnished by Michael the heavenly Prince : “ And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence . ”

But out of the “ many ” there were some that awoke and put themselves into postwar action , but it was to “ reproaches and everlasting abhorrence ” that these awoke .
This is shown in the words of Paul to Timothy , at 1 Timothy 3 : 7 , where it states that the overseer should also have a favorable testimony from people on the outside in order that he might not fall into reproach and a snare of the Devil .

Even new clothing , if filthy , is a reproach .
Is one not happier enduring reproach than suffering the chastisement of a good conscience trained in Jehovah ’ s Word ?

When completed , Jehovah said significantly : “ Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you . ”
It is true that , in the event of a resolution , they could go to tribunals , but I believe that , in the majority of EU countries - at least , Commissioner , in yours and in mine - the indefinite extension of cases would lead to the bankruptcy of distributors .
As stated in the motion for a resolution tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left , but which was not , unfortunately , voted for , it is now time to radically change the status quo , specifically by disbanding NATO and the WEU , by insisting on the development and the strengthening of the OSCE and by providing ourselves with the appropriate material and financial resources . These are clearly ideas that the majority of the European Parliament does not support .
Not because I am against the accession of the new members , but because the resolution does not mention material issues relating to enlargement : the promotion of an elitist policy in central and eastern European countries servile to the Americans ; the break - up of the public sector and of public property ; the enforced liberalism which creates social unhappiness ; the lack of significant Community resources to help these countries with the integration process ; the failure to organise referenda on enlargement in the Member States .
Enhancing what car , bus and lorry drivers can see behind them by introducing new technologies which increase the resolution of rear- view mirrors is a measure which must surely deserve all our support and encouragement .
This resolution calls for free and fair elections without foreign interference , the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon , the disbanding and disarmament of all militias and the extension of government control to all Lebanese territories .

The resolution stipulates the disbanding of all militias in Lebanon .
- ( CS ) Madam President , allow me to explain why I abstained from voting on the resolution concerning the closure of the Guantánamo prison .
I welcome John Bowis &apos; s excellent report and his skilful resolution of the many legitimate concerns that were with the original draft proposal .
This administrative simplification mainly involves approval procedures and financial planning and management , including control activities and the resolution of discrepancies .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that in the EU there needs to be enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce or legal separation .
The European Parliament - and this is another noteworthy aspect of the resolution - also wishes to make a point to the Committee of the Regions , given that the problem of the forthcoming expiry of the Secretary - General &apos; s term of office has arisen ; the possibility of falling back on Article 50 has been mooted , with considerable financial implications , as it is estimated that the operation has already cost ECU 320 000 .
In Mali , the lack of resolution in the conflict in the North of the country was the main reason invoked by Captain Amadou Haya Sanogo to remove Amadou Toumani Touré from power .
Qasim also serves on the board of Seeds of Peace , an international NGO working on international conflict resolution .

But what if such high - resolution pictures are used , not by farmers and prospectors , but by intelligence agents of a hostile country ?
“ The subject of what level of resolution civil survey satellites should be allowed to have has been heatedly debated in the United Nations , ” says Technology Review .

This robotic surveyor mapped 84 percent of an entire planet to a resolution of a football stadium during it s first 8 months in orbit ....
Trento continues : “ Their resolution was so superior that license plate numbers on parked cars could be clearly read .
Now , according to Scientific American , “ Hubble has a resolution of at least 10 times better than that of any ground - based instrument , so it can see clearly throughout a volume of space 1,000 times larger &#91; than other telescopes &#93; . ”
Since resolution is poor even in instruments of that size , astronomers link up radio telescopes in arrays by computer with a technique called radio interferometry .
This type of linkup is called very long baseline interferometry ( VLBI ) , and it results in resolution of one thousandth of an arc second , or the capability to distinguish a six - foot - &#91; 1.8 m &#93; square structure on the moon .
The resolution of the human eye is one arc minute .
The greater the separation of the receivers , the greater the resolution of the final image .
The new space - based telescope provides a resolution 1,000 times higher than the Hubble Space Telescope achieves in visible light .
“ At that resolution , ” states Science News , “ an observer in Los Angeles could discern a grain of rice in Tokyo . ”
At any rate , it has been estimated that the resolution on older video display units would have to be improved tenfold for them to produce excellent visual quality .
And we &apos; re zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times to obtain the resolution , so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time .
And so what my team of researchers , what we wanted to do , is say , can we apply genetic and proteomic technology to go after DNA and proteins , and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution to really understand what &apos; s going on ?
Well , it turns out we can see inside the human brain , and in fact not surprisingly , the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year .
This is at an early stage , but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning , we will succeed in reverse - engineering the human brain by the 2020s .
There are also robots , for example , who can recognize weeds with a resolution of half an inch .
We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution -- enormous polygonal count .
For me , or for my purpose at this moment , there &apos; s still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale , on the one hand , and resolution and speed , on the other .
In addition to higher resolution versions of this display , my father and I are working on a new patent - pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon .
Since then we &apos; ve had WMAP , which just gives us higher angular resolution .
One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale . We change scale very often : we change resolution of screens , and we &apos; re not really fazed by it , we do it very comfortably .
Harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution .
So that storytelling , like all other contradictions in the universe , is looking for harmony and infinity in moral resolutions , resolving one , but letting another go , letting another go and creating a question that is really important .
Technology in X - ray where it &apos; s life - size processed , apart from these large cargo - scanning machines , hasn &apos;t moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it , which is show my pictures big .
Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year .
They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution .
So this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet , and we &apos; re able to get resolution where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body .
And so we can accurately -- if the magnet is big enough , and your resolution is high enough -- you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system .
But when it &apos; s backlit , it &apos; s color ; and when it &apos; s frontlit , it &apos; s black and white at three times the resolution .
They &apos; re really high resolution , and they &apos; re really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today .
It &apos; s very high - resolution , and it &apos; s our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details .
And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners , that just in 0.3 seconds , I can scan the whole heart , and I can do that with time resolution .
I mean it &apos; s probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient &apos; s heart before you actually do surgery , and do that with high -quality resolution data .
And connecting also with the previous talk here , this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working , how the brain is working , and we can do this with very , very high visual quality and very fast resolution .
The ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible .
Here you &apos; re going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today , reconstructed of Marc Hodosh , the curator of TEDMED .
And now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available , and essentially learn how to reconstruct , and maybe even re-engineer , or backwards engineer , the brain so we can better understand pathology , disease and therapy .
That means that those of us in this room who are less than 50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved , and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see the resolution , but our children and grandchildren certainly will .
We know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part - session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings .
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea , and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament &apos; s position , as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted , clear as far as Russia is concerned .
Mr President , the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution , in this ever controversial debate , which is the result of a broad consensus , seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes .
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel / Syria question might be promising .
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution ; instead they are calling for a new burden , they are calling for more bureaucracy , for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary &apos; s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee , contrary to several resolutions by Parliament .
As far as the resolution is concerned , of which I have seen a draft , the Commission will await the vote and will , based on this , determine its stance .
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in it s vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria .
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results .
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important , such as peace - building , conflict prevention and resolution , food security , fisheries and immigration .
I personally feel that issues such as peace - building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State , with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter .
The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party , the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground , and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission , potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing .
Mr President , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict can not be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union .
The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future , that leaves no room for foreign interventions , like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years , is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN &apos; s Security Council .
Therefore , it is my firm belief that , since Helsinki , there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict .
Let me name just two small ones : the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8 , from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria .
As Parliament , we are , of course , expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this , which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten , as has almost happened already .
On the question of Angola , I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last .
A strong vote for this resolution will assist the Convention to complete its task and set criteria for this Parliament &apos; s final appraisal of the results .
This is a matter which falls under international law , and in particular various UN resolutions , and the responsibility of the UN Secretary - General , whose efforts to find a just , equitable and durable solution have been consistently supported by the European Union .
In particular , with regard to Italy , to lay down a period of not more than six months within which to apply the sanctions would be against the Italian Constitution , which , in fact , provides for the adoption of a constitutional resolution .
I would therefore appeal to France do so in the course of its own forthcoming presidency and , last but not least ( and if nothing has happened by then ) , to my own country , Sweden , to take measures during its own presidency with a view to achieving a peaceful resolution of this conflict after all these years .
We want Russia to comply with its OSCE / Council of Europe commitments and seek a political settlement , allow independent investigations on reported human rights abuses , improve the climate for an independent press to operate , and address the legitimate requests of humanitarian operators . These issues are also mentioned in your resolution .
I have therefore written to the European Patent Office in Munich requesting that it should explore every possibility to bring about a speedier resolution of this issue .
We have taken action which - based upon the full cooperation of the European Patent Office - will , I believe , bring about a speedy resolution of this unfortunate occurrence .
We have stipulated in the resolution that the Commission will have two years to solve this and I have been given assurances that this should be possible .
Europe must now also commit itself to the prevention and resolution of armed conflicts , the provision of humanitarian aid for famines and the treatment of illnesses such as Aids or malaria which decimate the African population .
Motion for a resolution ( B5-0322 / 2000 ) by Mr Cox and Mr Jensen , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on the outcome of the Extraordinary European Council in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000
Motion for a resolution ( B5-0331 / 2000 ) by Mr Figueiredo and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , on the outcome of the Extraordinary European Council in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March
Motion for a resolution ( B5-0333 / 2000 ) by Mr Queiró and others , on behalf of the UEN Group , on the outcome of the Extraordinary European Council in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000
Motion for a resolution ( B5- 0335 / 2000 ) by Mr Flautre and others , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group , on the outcome of the European Council in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000 : Presidency &apos; s conclusions
We think the Oil for Food Programme is still the best short - term solution to ease the suffering of the Iraqi population , and the Iraqi government should reverse its policy of non-cooperation and comply with all the United Nations Security Council resolutions , as has been said .
It also means there is a chance this resolution - expressing our indignation - might be heard in Iran , where the results of the recent elections have raised the hope of progress there on fundamental human rights . As everyone who has already spoken has said , it is our duty to ensure that those rights are respected .
We must reject these threats since they are absolutely unacceptable , but also because they are an objective threat to the dialogue which is so necessary to the resolution of this problem .
It is no good us debating conflict resolution in the Parliament and then finding that the sole support to assist people when the guns are put down or when the period of immediate humanitarian assistance is at an end is then forgotten altogether .
As someone who was in the last Parliament I know how much thankless time and effort they have put in since BSE first began in a very difficult area to try and find a resolution and a way forward to help everyone in a very sensible way .
Resolution of the debt issue must be accompanied by actions promoting local development .
Yet out of despair comes resolution , determination and hope .
Perhaps the most important outcome of the resolutions of the Cologne , Helsinki and Lisbon summits is precisely the fact that they have restored Europe &apos; s sense of initiative , giving it the motivation needed in order to accept responsibility , make an effort and honour its obligations .
However , certain conditions were indicated in the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council , particularly with reference to the resolution under international law of the conflicts involving the Aegean .
The EU is encouraging the resolution of this conflict so that these people can return to their homes as quickly as possible and is ready to offer additional assistance in this event .
In this particular case we believe that the Agreement has its own negotiating context and it would not be right , after the Agreement has been approved by the European Union and agreed by the Council , to make its final signing dependent on the resolution of an issue , however important this may be , which is only one part of the whole picture .
We can not turn the European Union into a kind of technical instrument for the practical resolution of specific situations .
It has achieved this by contributing to the resolution of regional conflicts and particularly by ensuring that there is not just one regional conflict mediator available in the world , namely the United States of America , but that Europe can also assume what is one of its main historic vocations and one of the decisive factors in the European project .
Mr President , I would also like to draw the attention of the Portuguese Presidency to the fact that the aim of Article 8 of our resolution is , from within the European Parliament , to make a positive contribution to resolving the running conflict with Austria .
Meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the results of the Special Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations entitled &apos; Women 2000 : gender equality , development and peace for the twenty - first century &apos; of 5 - 9 June 2000 held in New York and at which Astrid Lulling , Member of the European Parliament , participated .
I do , however , deplore the fact that this proposal is set to replace a resolution on Venezuela which is the follow up to a visit to that country by an official delegation from the European Parliament following the serious floods which devastated that country , especially as we have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter since then .
It was not least for this reason - since these measures are of course devoid of any legal base - that Parliament &apos; s President , Nicole Fontaine , pointed out at the beginning of the Feira summit that the European Parliament had adopted a resolution on 15 June calling on the Council to analyse relations between Austria and the other 14 Member States , and to draw up with all the parties concerned a procedure which would enable a solution to be found which would be acceptable to everyone .
It is at the discretion of the Federal Trade Commission whether it takes them into consideration . The company responsible for processing the data also has the option of recourse to a private dispute resolution body of its choice , but this right is not available to the person whose rights may have been violated .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are just about to vote , for the thirteenth time , on a resolution concerning Tibet , and we have to say , if we examine the effect these have had in the past , it is exceptionally poor .
We must put pressure on the international oil companies and on investors . We must , as is stated in point 8 of the resolution , strongly urge these companies to cease their activities in Sudan until a peaceful solution to the conflict has been found .
One solution to this dilemma would be to speed up research into the possibility of obtaining stem cells from adult organs , which could be clearly earmarked for therapeutic purposes , as called for in the resolution tabled by our fellow Members , Elisabeth Montfort and Nicole Thomas - Mauro .
Mr President , the resolution that we have before us today is not intended in any way to criticise the key actors namely the Bhutanese or Nepalese Governments in the process of finding a solution for the 96 000 Nepalese speaking Bhutanese refugees living in the camps .
Let us hope that our resolution will bring some justice to these people , will help them re-settle in their homelands and achieve some results .
We are failing to use a mechanism which would to such a large extent maximise the resources , which are becoming scarcer , dedicated to aid as the political result of a joint effort , despite the repeated requests of this Parliament and the repeated resolutions of the Council itself , which basically has ultimate responsibility in this area .
It is a common sense balance to a difficult issue and I would appeal to the House to support the resolution as put forward by the Legal Affairs Committee .
Quite the contrary . The Commission shares the concern that honourable Members have expressed about the fact that perhaps in an increasingly general way , but particularly where e-commerce is concerned , the extra-judicial resolution of disputes is , without a shadow of a doubt , a much better solution in most cases than resorting to judicial procedures .
It is because the Commission does , in fact , share the idea that extrajudicial resolution must become the rule but that , in order to provide an incentive for people to seek recourse to this extrajudicial approach , there must be clear principles for the alternative , that is the judicial route .
There must therefore be rules on the jurisdiction of the courts in those cases - which the Commission hopes will be rare - where an alternative form of resolution is not possible or does not produce a satisfactory result .
We are therefore convinced that these initiatives , which are already under way , and on which there will have to be a full debate with civil society , with interested parties , with associations representing industry , business and consumers and , of course , with the European Parliament , will enable us to put in place , in the short term , a legal reference framework which will establish alternative dispute resolution mechanisms .
We also accept Amendments Nos 18 - in part - and 29 , but we have difficulty in accepting Article 55 , which seeks , for the purposes of compulsory implementation , to give extrajudicial dispute resolution the same status as authentic acts that have been recognised by a body which has public authority .
We must however also point out that the definitive solution , a fair and lasting solution , must fully comply with both the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions , with this being , quite simply , the international law in force , and also the principles governing the European Union .
As far as Cyprus is concerned , despite the fact that the Poos report contains much that is true , we feel , in addition to the foregoing , that the process of integration into the European Union and the decisions taken at Helsinki will not only fail to resolve the problem of the occupation in accordance with UN resolutions ; they will legitimise the occupation and the definitive partition of the island .
Naturally , we all hope that the Cyprus question will be resolved in the meantime in accordance with the UN resolutions and the summit agreements , so that all the indigenous - I repeat indigenous - population of the island , Greek - Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot , can enjoy the benefits of membership .
Our rapporteur , Mr Titley , is proposing a bold resolution to Parliament .
In short , I believe I can safely say that the administration now has all the possible levers at its disposal in order to fulfil it s task efficiently and within the timeframe provided , and I assume that the European Parliament can invite the administration to make the results of this legislative resolution felt as soon as possible .
Mr President , I abstained from voting on the resolution on the results of the informal Biarritz European Council for two reasons : firstly , because I had the opportunity to vote in person on Paragraphs 2 and 5 separately , which allowed me to express my total opposition to both .
We have to find a way forward . We have to find a resolution to the situation .
On the subject of the said motion for a resolution , I would like to highlight our firm support for the European Commission to continue negotiating with Morocco , and our call for Morocco to negotiate and find the best , most beneficial solution for both parties , as this is possible and must be found .
As far as Parliament is concerned , the phase we are about to enter is the outcome of a long struggle , one we undertook as early as 1975 and which has been continually highlighted through our resolutions , our Spinelli draft treaties , our draft European constitutions .
We should also be clear that the resolution of extraordinarily difficult problems such as Cyprus , which requires the assent of all the people of Cyprus , will not be helped by frustrating Turkish progress towards accession .
And thirdly , how can this sort of text simply include the Commission &apos; s ridiculous statement on the Cyprus question to the effect that Turkey has to support the efforts of the Secretary - General of the UN rather than accept a solution based on the resolutions of the UN ?
I am sure Parliament can see these results are in line with the resolution of 5 October which I mentioned earlier .
As regards the most sensitive issues that remain to be resolved , notably in relation to Kosovo , the European Parliament has always hoped that peaceful solutions will be found , in accordance with UN resolutions on the integrity and sovereignty of Yugoslavia , in terms of fundamental human rights .
Hence the motion for a resolution that we are tabling following a project that was started a while ago by Parliament &apos; s delegation to Central America , chaired by Mr Salafranca , and which we have modestly continued with during our term of office .
But the repression perpetrated by the regime only strengthens the rebellious feelings that can arise there and does not in any way , shape or form , lead to a resolution of potential ethnic conflicts .
While its extension to trade in services is an understandable aim , it has little to do with the main issue of institutional reform , which needs to be resolved as a matter of priority ; the demand contained in point 7 of the joint resolution regarding the extension of external negotiating competence in the field of trade to cover investment has even less to do with this main issue .
If we as Europeans can not play a responsible role in the resolution of this conflict , independently of the United States , we must assume that we shall not be trusted to act as a mediator in any other regional conflicts either .
Fourthly , the OSCE must be strengthened and endowed with enough resources for the prevention and resolution of conflicts in accordance with the fundamental principles of its security policy and not through the creation of storm troops .
Although we have not won , we have achieved a result in this resolution , which does not leave us defeated on the battlefield .
I think hastily adopting a short resolution , as Mr Poettering proposes , would be a feeble , unimaginative solution .
China justified its decision to veto the draft resolution , saying it wants to promote peace in Syria , and Russia claims to hope for a diplomatic approach to resolving the conflict in the country .
Dalai Lama also thanked the president for his “ steady encouragement ” and support toward finding a “ peaceful peaceful resolution to the problems in Tibet . ”
The political chaos in which Guinea Bissau finds itself embroiled - still more so since the April 2012 coup d &apos; etat - may be a little closer to finding a resolution with the recent appointment of Nobel Peace Prize winner and former President of East Timor , José Ramos - Horta , to lead the United Nations Integrated Peace - Building Office ( UNIOGBIS ) in the country from February .
Resolutions were adopted calling for action against the following problems :
This contradiction is one that Church theologians have long wrestled with , but without resolution .
The “ Life and Peace ” resolution called for the nations to make peace by bringing their “ negotiations to positive conclusions ” and by “ the total elimination of all nuclear weapons within five years . ”
When those involved remain reasonable , however , a resolution can be reached .
Because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma , the resolution of which , it &apos; s fair to say , would determine not only the future course of our psychology , but the future course of the entire world .
And it typically involves making multiple , low - resolution prototypes very quickly , often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution .
Do you believe , and can you tell us why , there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis ?
Commissioner , I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented .
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures .
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing , it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing .
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses .
The appeal by the European Socialists , on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel , raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation . A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly , through Mr Guterres , by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control .
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day , but I suppose better late than never .
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own , in the east of England , outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response .
I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957 . This is an economic community , of course , but it is also , primarily , a community of values .
With regard to foreign affairs , I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism , Mr President . Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty , the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world , demand a clear , visible and effective response from the European Union .
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms , these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously .
But of course , as others have said , this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate , woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness .
The last Parliament exercised this new responsibility on six occasions , but only once did it lead to a legislative proposal being brought forward by the Commission in response to our request , namely the proposals originating in the report of my colleague , Mr Rothley , on insurance for people using their vehicles in other Member States .
Subject to this condition , then , what this directive proposes is Europe &apos; s initial model response to the legitimate feeling aroused due to the pollution caused by the wreck of the Erika .
We see this in its response to legitimate international concerns about its human rights record .
In response to a European Parliament resolution in 1997 the Commission has conducted an awareness - raising campaign on domestic violence within the Member States .
The Commission proposals and Parliament &apos; s response give a clear acknowledgement that the market can and should be the motor for much of this change , but not in every case .
Finally , I would like to emphasise the figures concerning the international response .
It has already been said in this debate that the European response has , relatively speaking , shown that Europe actually cares .
And we also have the response by the Commission , which must be very recent , and which Commissioner Liikanen , as a member of the College , must remember perfectly .
This met with the response that the rapid alert system procedures are not very user - friendly , nor is it very clear as to when exactly the alarm has to be raised .
Some of my post are responses to blog posts by others in Cambodian Blogosphere .
Rime , from Mosaic , echoes that sentiment of frustration towards the response of the international community and international media :
&quot; Konbit Pou Ayiti says that &quot; &quot; Haiti KONPAY has been playing a critical role coordinating a rapid response to the crisis in both Jacmel and Port - au - Prince ... pursuing two major strategies &quot; &quot; : &quot;
In his post and response to comments at Personal Reflections , a former senior public servant Jim Belshaw joins other commentators in arguing that good governance will be affected in that governments will become more secretive and less candid in private :
To my mind , the biggest danger created by wikileaks lies in the nature of likely Government responses .
Responses to the Death of North Korean Dictator , Kim Jong - il · Global Voices
Unsurprisingly , the South Korean Twittersphere has lit up with numerous responses to the news .
&quot; In response , more than 900 websites decided to &quot; &quot; go dark &quot; &quot; and display an anti-ACTA message . &quot;
We can roughly divide the response into four categories :
TMS Ruge started the # StopIC hashtag on Twitter in response to the film .
These spread quickly and stirred other users to share emotional responses
But what about those on the ground in India - what has been their response ?
If you greet them with a smile and with a cheerful salutation , it may surprise you what response you will get .
So great was the response that by midnight Tuesday , just thirty - six hours after receiving the word , a convoy of five vehicles including a ten - ton truck left Lima headed for Casma and Chimbote with relief supplies !
As with plants , there obviously is some mechanism within animals that triggers their various responses to length of light .
It would not take you long to appreciate this horse ’ s quick responses .
“ Immunity ” has been described as “ an everyday word , ordinarily applied to the elaborate set of responses by which the body defends itself against invading microorganisms . ”
Involved in these responses are a number of different kinds of white blood cells or corpuscles that serve as defenders of the purity of the bloodstream .
Regarding their response to his teaching in the synagogue one sabbath day , we read : “ The greater number of those listening were astounded and said : ‘ Where did this man get these things ?
It was begun as a hasty response to an immediate crisis : the crisis thought to have been brought about by Soviet space triumphs ....
Recently , research indicates that the genes play a vital role in this response .
Concerning a boa constrictor , they wrote : “ If a brain response is accepted as indicative of hearing , these snakes can hear airborne sound . ” — Science , March 14 , 1969 , Vol .
Meantime , we are moving into shallower water and her every response must be watched carefully .
A collision due to lack of close attention , mechanical defect or sluggish response is ever a risk in such situations .
Besides your reaction to questions , there are , we might say , three responses to the early statements of a child that will have much effect on his progress in speech .
In such a condition , a person may receive mental suggestions , or the emotional response may be so vivid that he feels that he has been touched by God .
The long - awaited ban is a government response to scientists who warn of possible climate changes and increased skin cancer on every continent .
A story , a work of art , a face , a designed object -- how do we tell that something is beautiful ? And why does it matter so much to us ? Designer Richard Seymour explores our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhibit it .
And I would be very interested to get your responses to this .
So I just want to show you some of the responses we &apos; ve elicited from animals in the deep sea .
And then finally , I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world &apos; s first deep - sea webcam , which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year .
But we did see a bunch of responses like this .
So after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African , I began to understand my roommate &apos; s response to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Non-theist &quot; &quot; will do for all that , yet unlike &quot; &quot; atheist , &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t have the same phobic , hysterical responses . &quot;
Without a vaccine , these responses would have taken more than a week .
The developing world , mostly left out of the current response , sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they &apos; re leapfrogging the West .
And these dyes change color in response to odors .
So , we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening .
I take it from your response they don &apos;t look the same anymore . Right ?
But it &apos; s almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response , but can &apos;t quite control it .
The institutional response is , I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great , that &apos; s what I &apos; ll do .
Now , when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology , we got a very good response .
So we actually grew our consciousness in response to this global threat .
And so it &apos; s going to try to watch your response .
In a particularly dangerous environment , the characteristic manifestations of PTSD -- a hyper - awareness of one &apos; s surroundings , a quick - trigger response to danger -- could save someone &apos; s life .
And after a while , I developed what I think many of us do , is this predictable response , where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them .
We are in danger , all of us , and we &apos; ve evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response , to help us bravely face a threat .
That &apos; s why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on , because if we wait until the crisis takes hold , we may panic and hide .
But I think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months , maybe their first year , that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion .
And this is a real underestimated , under- appreciated health hazard -- not just because it harms our hearing , which it obviously does , but it actually initiates the fight - or - flight response .
A loud noise will get your fight - or - flight response going .
&quot; Now what &apos; s the right response to that ? &quot; &quot; Yeah , right ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Now , here &apos; s the experiment we did , and I would hope this is going to convince you that &quot; &quot; Yeah , right ! &quot; &quot; was not the right response . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Yeah , right &quot; &quot; is not the right response ! &quot;
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .
Mr President , may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .
First of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response .
&quot; However , if your response was to be that we should turn to &quot; &quot; Mr CFSP &quot; &quot; , that is , to Mr Solana , then I fear that this would constitute a one - sided approach to an external policy matter . &quot;
The Commission sympathises with these considerations . In the light of this sympathy , I would like to continue my response as follows .
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us , an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions , rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30 , and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level , at regional level and at local government level .
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for your response to the Member &apos; s first question and the supplementary question .

Mr President , Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason .
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication .
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution .
You are relying mainly on further deregulation in the internal market , on the Internet revolution and on e-commerce and e-business to be job machines .
An information technology revolution is certainly upon us . We can not be passengers when these changes take place .
This means that we are not talking about a revolution , but merely about enshrining in law what is today already practised in the Court of Justice of the European Communities in its relations with the European Convention on Human Rights itself and the Strasbourg Court .
The electronic revolution seems to have given more freedom to exploiters , the paedophiles and the pornographers , than to industrialists .

Mr President , Madam Vice - President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , it is common knowledge that , at regional level in the European Union , there is a close connection between low per capita income , high unemployment and distance from mainland Europe or geographical remoteness , which is currently a serious problem , but which has existed since the industrial revolution of the 19th century , due to underdeveloped communications .
We are witnessing a new industrial revolution . Consequently , the structure of the European economy is in need of legal infrastructures and , tomorrow , we are going to meet that need .
The social market economy also means solidarity and paying due attention to the more vulnerable strata of society which , in the industrial revolution sparked off by the Internet , also now include those who do not know how to use a computer .

Saying &apos; no &apos; to institutional revolution does not mean turning our backs on innovation .
Finally , Commissioner Patten has said that we do not necessarily need institutional revolution , perhaps just reforms .

Firstly , it appears to contain an error , for it mentions a 1998 budget of as much as EUR 10 940 000 million - at least in the Italian version - which seems to me at first sight to be rather too great a sum . There has to be an error of at least 3 decimal points .
Still on the subject of commissioners , the sight of Mr Barnier shamelessly pretending to speak for the Irish people and learnedly explaining to the readers of Le Figaro on 11 June the three reasons for the Irish &apos; no &apos; vote , which , according to him , have nothing to do with the Treaty of Nice , reflects the same total disregard for the sovereignty of nations .

&quot; And that brings me to my first major of two tenets of &quot; &quot; Half the Sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
European skies are comparatively safe , and we want to see that safety preserved .

Mr President , we meet at a time when congestion in our skies has never been greater .
It seems obvious that we need to completely rethink the organisation of air traffic control in the European sky .
It also seems obvious that the political division of the European sky no longer corresponds to the technical requirements and market requirements .
It is obvious that , if we want a single sky , we need to make investments , as the report clearly states .
&quot; Mr President , Commissioner , I think there is some ambiguity regarding the expression &quot; &quot; single European sky &quot; &quot; , because air traffic control is in fact , as you are well aware , already a European field of activity . &quot;
Mr President , this report takes as its starting point an observation which is familiar to all Members of the European Parliament , as frequent users of aircraft as a means of transport : the skies are becoming more and more congested as a result of the growing demand for this form of transport .
There has been talk of the fact that there are too many aircraft in the sky , that one controller has too many aircraft to deal with , etc . , but we need only look at the United States of America , which is the most advanced country in the world in terms of aeronautics , where these problems are dealt with and , although they may not be completely resolved , adequate solutions have been found .
By creating one single European sky , we will provisionally have enough airspace to allow us to come up with structural measures to impede the unbridled growth of aviation , based on the current state of affairs .
It is therefore absolutely essential that Vice - President de Palacio take decisive action , as she has done so far , in order to establish a real single European sky .
Increasing numbers of intolerable delays are not , as has already been stated , solely due to overcrowding in the sky , but to also the airlines &apos; attempt , for reasons of cost -effectiveness , to rotate their planes with excessively short , unreasonable and ultimately impossible turnarounds .
This democratisation is admittedly welcome , but raises important questions for the future : increased traffic , overcrowded airports , congested skies and lack of respect for the environment , in particular in terms of noise pollution .
We all know that the considerable increase in air traffic is the main underlying cause of overcrowded and saturated skies .
Naturally , the single sky must be set up through a reformed Eurocontrol and harmonised control services at European level .
Commissioner , I hope that , in preparing the future directive on the single sky , the Commission will be able to handle this matter by taking a calmer and more impartial overall view .
&quot; Mr President , I am acting as the representative of the air traffic controllers protesting against the European Commission proposal which , in the name of the attractive slogan &quot; &quot; single European sky &quot; &quot; , will clear the way for the privatisation of air traffic control . &quot;
So I welcome the fact that the Commission has submitted a report on these important subjects and that a High Level Group was set up to consider the problems of establishing a single European sky .
Report ( A5- 0141 / 2000 ) by Mr Atkins , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament - The creation of the single European sky ( COM ( 1999 ) 614 - C5-0085 / 2000 - 2000 / 2053 ( COS ) )
Mr Atkins &apos; s report on the European Commission proposal on the single European sky goes along with this rationale of liberalisation at any price .
I wish therefore to pay tribute to the determination of Mrs de Palacio , the Commissioner responsible for transport , in tackling the problem head - on in order to achieve the creation of a single European sky as soon as possible .
We can not , of course , deny that there is a need to improve the situation of regulation and air traffic control in Europe in the spirit of the single European sky .
In conclusion , I would like to emphasise the importance of efficient management in the aviation industry in reducing pollutants , placing the emphasis on improving airport management and clearly supporting the creation of a single European sky , by means of which we would also undoubtedly contribute to reducing environmental pollution .
We shall coordinate the actions of the various Member States within the CAEP , given that it is the Member States that are the signatories of the ICAO , and I hope that Parliament will support initiatives such as the single sky , to which Mr Ojeda referred , which , naturally , will also have consequences for kerosene saving , if it can be implemented , and the improvement in the allocation and general management of slots .
Others , through internal disputes , as the Swedish Prime Minister has said in his capacity as President of the Council , have not been able to reach the necessary agreement for the single European sky , and so it has not been possible to turn what were good proposals at Lisbon into a reality .
Having the opportunity to speak in this debate gives me the chance to welcome not only the Council &apos; s conclusions on the creation of a single European sky , but its determination to submit proposals on slot allocation at Community airports to Parliament by June .
I shall finish by referring in this context to the intention of creating a single European sky that has been put forward by both the presidency of the Council and that of the Commission , and I should like to say to Mr Prodi that we trust that the Commission will act in this matter with the determination and prudence needed in view of the commitments undertaken , and in any case in accordance with the Community acquis .

&quot; Finally , we are hoping that , in the committees of experts , the greatest cooperation will be open to all parties concerned , notably in relation to the creation of the &quot; &quot; single sky &quot; &quot; or problems relating to air control . &quot;
The passenger protection dossier is , together with the single sky , safety and protection of the environment , an important dossier for air transport , for passengers and also for the image of European integration in the eyes of the public .
Sixth , the high speed rail interoperability of the Iberian network , by adapting it to the track gauge of the rest of the European continent , which will ease sky and land congestion .

From the transport point of view , Mr President , the Presidency believes that the Barcelona Summit should have two objectives : on the one hand , to promote the single sky package for air transport , and on the other , to promote the railways package in order to gradually introduce competition into the provision of services , essentially in relation to the transport of goods .
We have also reached agreement on the entry into force of the &apos; Single European Sky &apos; in 2004 , which will reduce flying time , cut air travel costs , and make air traffic management more efficient , and , finally , we have agreed to give top priority to developing broadband networks , as the essential element in developing the Information Society .
In 2004 , the gas and electricity markets will be opened for all European businesses , the Member States will have a surplus budgetary balance , the directive on taxation of energy products will come into force , and the Single European Sky will be implemented .
We are being asked to give a free hand in the deregulation of air transport through the single sky project and in the continued liberalisation of the railways .
To do this , we must provide the same level of security , for a single sky , and a single certification in a single market .
I am referring to our capabilities to tackle arms of mass destruction , NBC - nuclear , bacteriological or chemical - and also to our intelligence capabilities , the ability of our forces to protect themselves during missions and , finally , our capability to protect what has come to be known as the common space or European single sky .

The Commissioner cited - and I will mention it again - the recent agreement between the United Kingdom and Spain concerning the inclusion in the legislative act on the Single European Sky of the so - called &apos; Gibraltar clause&apos;

Mr President , a European Union which can not play a clearly defined role in terms of security and defence creates uncertainty on the world stage .
The Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on the other hand , does not seem to see any direct link between the continuous presence of Slobodan Milosevic on the political stage of the Balkans and the continuing instability in the region , one year on from the end of NATO &apos; s intervention against Serbia &apos; s ethnic cleansing which affected Kosovo on a massive scale .

And a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well .
One study at an American university found that 61 percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse .
And other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play , but I didn &apos;t really understand what it was .
They &apos; d given me a large grant when I was an academician for the study of felony drunken drivers , and I thought I had a pretty good track record , and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
And in Paris , the IPCC released it s study confirming man &apos; s impact on global warming .
Similarly , a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters , and don &apos;t put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it .
We looked at an MIT study : ten million electric cars on the global roads .
A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries .
A recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real - life relationships with them .
A recent study from &#91; University of Michigan &#93; showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship - management tools .
Well , the best example I know is a study of 79,000 men followed over 20 years , in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week had up to a 50 percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer .
But what &apos; s even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer , those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer .
So this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can impact on cancer .
A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering , or men , I guess , are negotiating their first salary , and only seven percent of women .
There &apos; s a really good study that shows this really well .
There &apos; s a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen .
In one study , which we ran in Japantown , San Francisco , we brought seven - to nine - year - old Anglo - and Asian - American children into the laboratory , and we divided them up into three groups .
In a study I conducted with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali , American and French parents were interviewed .
And I guess one of the questions on everybody &apos; s mind is : How does that influence your study of choosing because that &apos; s an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on ?
Now the same data can be browsed on a computer from your own office or study .
It must be stated where the stuff has to go and how it is to be destroyed .
This means that , here too , we can do nothing by means of a ban on its own , but must say where the stuff should go .
A simple prohibition will not suffice , as it is not known what will then become of the stuff .
As someone once said , &apos; stuff happens &apos; . Is the world today safer than before the overthrow of the appalling Saddam ?
It is an improvement in terms of efficiency : we get more qualified majority voting , we get a legal personality , we get a great deal more on external relations and good stuff on justice and home affairs .
Are we just going to spend lots of money on bricks and mortar in a place where we could be doing much more coordinated stuff using the fantastic examples of Oxford , Cambridge and the other good universities across the European continent ?
When we hear all this stuff about how the European Constitution is now legal because all these parliamentarians have gone ahead with it , that does not invalidate the case for a referendum : it invalidates the case for representative democracy as it is .
Instead of talking about symptoms , it is time to get serious about the disease : the fact that we have used all the easy oil and are still addicted to the stuff .
She was able to spare some of my blushes and protect me from some of the awful stuff that was available !
A report recently issued after a two - year project makes it quite clear that it has a potential for terrorist organizations in the fabrication of nuclear devices with socalled reactor - grade plutonium , the stuff that is being produced at Sellafield and La Hague .
Quite frankly that was an open invitation to nick half the stuff in my office .
I am very interested in Global Voices and always read the stuff in there , so keep up the hard work .
My friend looks at me and says , “ You don ’ t have to deal with that stuff , right ? ” “ Why , because I &apos; m not Muslim ? ” I ask ?
Illustrating this point , New York City ’ s Consumer Affairs Commissioner told the Association of National Advertisers that advertising has convinced millions that &#91; a name brand of bleach &#93; is somehow better than the same stuff in any other bottle . ’
“ Many of my friends are into drugs , ” he continued , “ and they say you just have to stay off the hard stuff — pot is okay .
He ’ d get a job , then quit and spend the money on this stuff .
One day all this stuff will be mine , and then I ’ ll sell it . ”
To asbestos goes the dubious distinction of having revolutionized the construction industry — not once , but twice : first , in the global trend to put it in buildings ; second , in the sometimes mad rush to get the stuff out again .
However , so much of the offensive stuff remains on city pavements that it ranks as the third most common complaint that Parisians make about their city .
FOR some it is just the green stuff outside the house that they have to mow .
I find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like Head Start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future .
Even when we think or talk about recycling , lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities , diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled .
It &apos; s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . These can talk to each other .
&quot; And he said to the guy , &quot; &quot; Why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Then I found out , post exposure , that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff , that that filthy water will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure , potable drinking water .
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside , the stuff that costs nothing , because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together and where do we come out ?
&quot; I &apos; m interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines : that thinks , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t believe in any of this stuff . &quot;
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists , the poets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant , and all kinds of stuff .
And I would say that the small stuff counts . It really does .
And as valuable as that is in Los Altos , imagine what that does to the adult learner who &apos; s embarrassed to go back and learn stuff that they should have before , before going back to college .
Discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science .
But most medical researchers -- discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals , which are to eradicate disease , to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty .
And out in eastern Montana there &apos; s a lot of space , a lot of badlands , and not very many people , and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff .
&quot; I mean kids are studying this stuff and they &apos; ve got the word &quot; &quot; fluctus &quot; &quot; up there . That &apos; s wrong . &quot;
We &apos; ve got to change this stuff up fast .
He &apos; s all murky . There is little kids leaning on his leg , little ghosts flying around . We got ta clean this stuff up fast , ladies and gentlemen .
I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos; m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos; m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
We sat around talking about Fourier transforms , Bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
Writer and designer Graham Hill asks : Can having less stuff , in less room , lead to more happiness ? He makes the case for taking up less space , and lays out three rules for editing your life .
So you &apos; d think , with all this extra space , we &apos; d have plenty of room for all our stuff .
So I &apos; m going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
By all means , we should buy and own some great stuff .
So let &apos; s make room for the good stuff .
You have a belief : stuff will flow out of connected human beings .
I don &apos;t know what they &apos; re going to do with all that stuff .
I don &apos;t know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills .
Now there &apos; s a mood to put some of that stuff back in place , but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed .
It &apos; s so safe you could drink this stuff .
They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives , and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver , and the good stuff they kept for themselves .
At the moment , the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff , that we need oil .
Video : Look at all this stuff that &apos; s here for our campfire .
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered .
&quot; So , very first puzzle , sixth grade , my teacher said , &quot; &quot; Oh , let &apos; s see , that guy , he likes to make stuff . &quot;
Yeah , stuff like that was in the movie and she &apos; s promoting it .
Not a lot of cool , sexy stuff happening in dentistry .
And God forbid -- I think many doctors , if you really asked them , they don &apos;t really understand all this stuff either .
Meanwhile , in California , we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff .
You think he &apos; s a nice balding guy , but he &apos; s just declared war on the content business . Find the commercial stuff , mash it up , tell the story your way .
And I had a bit of a wake - up call in Amsterdam : I was there going into the design stores , and mixing with our crowd of designers , and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same , and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also .
There &apos; s no real word for stuff that makes us secure , but doesn &apos;t make us feel secure .
But if you know stuff , you &apos; re more likely to have your feelings match reality .
It &apos; s a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do .
So , they say the eyes are the windows of the soul -- turns out they &apos; re a window to a whole lot more stuff .
But we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it .
And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff . But as you think of coal , this is what burned wheat kernels look like . Not entirely unlike coal .
That is what bioenergy is . It is not ethanol . It is not subsidies to a few companies . It is not importing corn into Iowa because you &apos; ve built so many of these ethanol plants . It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture , from brute force into biological force . And in the measure that you can do that , you can clean some stuff , and you can clean it pretty quickly .
What are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading ? This is one of the gentle giants on the planet . He &apos; s one of the nicest human beings you &apos; ve ever met . His name is Hamilton Smith . He won the Nobel for figuring out how to cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes .
We &apos; ll never know if this stuff worked . Actually , I think the Federal Bureau of Investigation took it down for security purposes , sometime in the early 1900 s .
But the one thing that did come out of electricity is that we love this stuff so much .
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
They &apos; ve pretty much set field exposure limits , which all of the things in the stuff I &apos; ll show you today sort of sit underneath those guidelines .
They &apos; re dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh , but they can &apos; t . They &apos; re locked in because so many add - ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .
And if you &apos; re among the people who create the stuff , easy is hard .
The answer is that what you do , and the details are not terribly important here , is to make something more elaborate : You take several different layers of paper , each one containing it s own little fluid system , and you separate them by pieces of , literally , double - sided carpet tape , the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor .
&quot; Or that the &quot; &quot; World Weekly News &quot; &quot; makes stuff up ? &quot;
There is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals , but -- they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons .
If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff .
Mr President , to visitors from afar , the sea crossing to the Scottish islands is the stuff of romance , and indeed the beauty never fails to move both native and visitor .
Punctual trains and good comfortable transport become main objectives and , instead of just being the stuff of slogans and advertisements , become integral to the self - image of the entire train company , which recognises that without customers there is no business .
More and more enzymes enter also into the manufacture of food stuffs and the texts adopted seek to improve the safety of the use of these substances .
It beggars belief that these substances are used in toys , which children often stuff into their mouths !
The basic premise is that the oil industry has to be able to rid the process of this yellow stuff so that it does not pass into the atmosphere .
An eighteen - year - old boy who got “ hooked ” on drugs wrote : “ I have used all types of drugs , from hash , pot , acid to hard stuff .
Then they sell you harder stuff at discount prices , then boost the prices up when they got you hooked .
We feel we don ’ t have to go on to the hard stuff .
However , “ when they get to junior high and high school , they don ’ t really know how to make themselves sit down , get to work , and learn hard or boring stuff . ”
Yet the abalone shell is made of the same stuff as the chalk — calcium carbonate .
&quot; He &apos; s like , &quot; &quot; Good stuff , man . Columbian . Top of the line . Top of the line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I know , I &apos; m going to get vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot and poison and pollute , but I got this hard thing .
In every little cubic centimeter of space , whether or not there &apos; s stuff , whether or not there &apos; s particles , matter , radiation or whatever , there &apos; s still energy , even in the space itself .
Whatever you are , therefore , you are not the stuff of which you are made .
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , did you look at any of the stuff ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
That &apos; s why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet -- you know , Ophelia going mad and the play within the play , and Yorick &apos; s skull , and the gravediggers .
Basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web . You find some interesting content , say a TEDTalk , submit it to Reddit , and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it , vote it down if they don &apos; t .
&quot; Before life existed on Earth , there was just matter , inorganic dead &quot; &quot; stuff . &quot; &quot; How improbable is it that life arose ? And -- could it use a different type of chemistry ? Using an elegant definition of life , chemist Lee Cronin is exploring this question by attempting to create a fully inorganic cell using a &quot; &quot; Lego kit &quot; &quot; of inorganic molecules -- no carbon -- that can assemble , replicate and compete . &quot;
So we have to think differently if we &apos; re going to make stuff come alive .
Imagine way back , four and a half billion years ago , there is a vast chemical soup of stuff .
So when you think about the improbable nature of what I &apos; m going to tell you in the next few minutes , just remember , we came from stuff on planet Earth .
What is life ? What is this stuff of life ?
They &apos; re all made of the same stuff , but they want their shape to win .
And what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff ?
And we &apos; re really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .
Don &apos;t go and look for carbon , go and look for evolvable stuff .
This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning -- we &apos; ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us -- this is hard to teach .
I used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible , to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world .
Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet , off the power of sun , wind and waves , we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest , highest - emitting stuff imaginable .
It would not , strictly speaking , be a matter of so - called Petersberg - style tasks ( crisis prevention and peacekeeping in third countries , excluding defence of national territory or vital external interests ) , but the European Parliament constantly insists on raising a much larger objective , a common security and defence policy in the broad sense . In fact , that is the title of the resolution voted on today .
That needed to be said because it is not obvious at first , neither in the report &apos; s title , which talks about discrimination , nor on first reading of a text which is written in an occasionally strange style .
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994 , the Commission published a communication on this subject .
Mr President , amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate , I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer , that is to say , the modernisation of competition policy , which is the subject of the Commission &apos; s White Paper .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition - related subjects .
As regards the international aspect of competition policy , I can confirm , Mr Rapkay , that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject , to which Mrs Randzio - Plath has also drawn our attention .
Therefore , on behalf of my group , I would like to say that we support the Theato report ; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda .
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group .
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this .
The guidelines call for all staff working in the development sector to receive continuous training in &apos; gender mainstreaming &apos; but in recent years only around 50 people have been trained and there is still no compulsory training in the subject within the Directorate - General for Development .
As I point out in my question , one to two days , and not one to two hours , need to be devoted to the subject .
These two editors will be expanding our coverage on both subjects worldwide .
Of course you understand that talking about this subject in the Arab World is very taboo .
&quot; The wall of tradition and culture is so dense that it is nearly impossible to talk about this subject in public without being accused of being &quot; &quot; decadent , lewd and immoral . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In Russia Today , a Russian broadcasting channel , the subject is mentioned when discussing children born and raised in the Russian correctional system :
A few days ago , President Felipe Calderon gave a speech in which he called all Mexicans to unite during the celebrations , regardless of their different views in terms of religion , politics and attitudes on the subject of the bicentennial .
But the date is only a celebration for some ; the bicentennial has become a complex subject that has led to different opinions and reactions .
Of course , their authors often have an opinionated view on each of these subjects .
People expect our opinion on things , and we work hard to let our voice be heard on every subject we consider worthy .
The ongoing genocide against the Guarani - Kaiowá in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul has been receiving increasing attention in the alternative media , especially in the blogosphere , but it is still a forbidden subject in the mainstream media .
Even though this subject has been discussed for some time , it has not been given enough importance .
The youth gave a sermon on the subject “ Life in God ’ s New Order . ”
He spoke for forty minutes on the subject “ Meeting the Problems of Today ’ s Youth . ”
He will discuss such aspects as the manner in which you covered the subject and whether it was logically and coherently developed .
The second reason I listened to her was because I had an interest in the subject .
I liked what the Bible said about creation and other subjects .
Refusing to accept the Watch Tower Society ’ s literature on this subject , I went to the library and read books on Bible archaeology , and I was amazed to find that the Bible is historically accurate !
To them this is a subject that should be left mainly to parental and religious training , at least in its more intimate details .
In this way they come to face the subject without feeling it is a deep , dark secret .
A dedicated Christian must view this subject of friendship with a number of safeguarding Biblical principles in mind .
I found the subject of Iranian women immensely interesting , in the way the women of Iran , historically , seemed to embody the political transformation .
So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
&quot; Salman Khan talks about how and why he created the remarkable Khan Academy , a carefully structured series of educational videos offering complete curricula in math and , now , other subjects . He shows the power of interactive exercises , and calls for teachers to consider flipping the traditional classroom script -- give students video lectures to watch at home , and do &quot; &quot; homework &quot; &quot; in the classroom with the teacher available to help . &quot;
I &apos; m a biologist , and the central theorem of our subject : the theory of design , Darwin &apos; s theory of evolution by natural selection .
So anyway , today we &apos; ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimism .
I think that the World Trade Center in , rather an unfortunate way , brought architecture into focus in a way that I don &apos;t think people had thought of in a long time , and made it a subject for common conversation .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan is the use of Indian cheap labor that they import from India to build the roads , and then they send these people home once the roads are built .
It turns out there &apos; s an enormous amount of information already available on that subject , which is the Mars rover problem .
Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart , which is beauty .
Now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different .
In that year , what I did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys , looking at a lot of data on this subject .
I think it &apos; s time for the subject to go public .
So I went to Cambridge , because it was really the best place in the world then for x - ray crystallography . And x - ray crystallography is now a subject in , you know , chemistry departments .
So it knows something about the subject ; it knows about the length .
If you don &apos;t like the subject or the performance , you can hold the red .
Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures , I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject -- something that would interfere with the themes , so chocolate is very good , because it has -- it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance .
&quot; I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet &apos; s &quot; &quot; Haystacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don &apos;t imagine it should be .
Subject : Commission &apos; s rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports , the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens ? right to proper administration in the EU .
Subject : Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty , it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union .
This is an exercise in sovereignty , and in democracy for each population and every individual , but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights , and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given .
Furthermore , on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States , which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons , I shall , in the next few days , be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders .
Subject : Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up .
Subject : Information on European Union citizens condemned to death In the absence of a reply from the Council to Question P-2697 / 99 within the deadlines laid down in the European Parliament &apos; s Rules of Procedure , can the Council say whether it is or is not in possession of information on the numbers , the identities , the legal situations , the conditions of detention and the personal and family situations of nationals of Member States of the European Union condemned to death in other countries ?
Subject : Compensation for victims of fascist war Many rulings by Greek courts have confirmed that Greek citizens are entitled to compensation as victims of the nazi regime , while the war reparations which Germany owes Greece remain in abeyance and have not yet been paid .
Subject : Information for the public Will the Council draw up a list of parties which the electorate can safely vote for without running the risk of their country being ostracised ?
Secondly : the report deals with matters which have absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the report by calling in points 19 , 22 and 30 for measures such as rights for third country nationals to vote in local and European elections .
It seems that there is also a list of Greek subjects and I see that Turkey &apos; s Foreign Minister has stated that any country can make such lists .
Subject : Ability of dialysis - dependent people to travel in the EU The free movement of Member States &apos; citizens in the EU is a fundamental right .
Subject : Combating discrimination At the start of the twenty - first century , which signals a new departure by European society in the direction of greater democracy , cohesion and recognition of the contributions of all citizens , the unacceptable phenomena of racism and social exclusion can be observed .
Subject : Political intervention in Georgia &apos; s problems Georgia , the newly independent state , is encountering serious difficulties in consolidating democracy and raising its citizens &apos; standards of living .
Subject : Indication of religion on identity cards The independent data protection authority in Greece has raised the issue of the religion of Greek citizens being recorded on their identity cards , saying it affects people &apos; s private lives and can lead to discrimination against certain individuals .
When you referred to the studies that have been carried out , I became worried because the reason I am raising this matter is precisely due to the fact that French and Spanish citizens have alerted our attention to it and are asking for more information . Their concern arises because this has already been the subject of a debate in Parliament that was rejected , specifically in the framework of the directive on water .
Subject : Mr Gavin Howard and the Programme de Développement de la Région Nord ( PDRN II ) EEC ( DG VIII ) In a letter dated 2 February 2000 to Commissioner Nielson , I asked the Commission to resolve the compensation problems of a UK national , Mr Gavin Howard , who had previously worked as a technical adviser on an EU- sponsored project in the Central African Republic in 1996 .
Finally , on the subject of the education of all European citizens , you should remember that it is up to every Member State and every candidate country to ensure that this objective is achieved .
Subject : Public Council meetings One of the three goals of the French Presidency is to bring Europe closer to its citizens .
Subject : Subsidies for growing tobacco Tobacco growing in the European Union is subsidised to the tune of millions of euros per year while at the same time over half a million EU citizens die each year of diseases caused by tobacco .
This issue has to do with the acceptance of the Union by the people , which is the subject of much complaint .
There has been one gaping omission in all the remarks made on the subject of how it would be possible to create institutions enabling citizen participation .
The 370 million citizens of the EU are demanding action on this subject and they are right to do so .
&quot; On the subject of this report , they said , &quot; &quot; If you want to prevent fraud , it would be a good idea for the European Union funds not to pass through the State public bodies but to go straight to the citizens , for I am sad to say that corruption is widespread among public employees . &quot;
Something that comes to mind is that we ought not to get carried away with emotion or lead people down the wrong path on this whole subject .
Subject : Inadequate enforcement of animal protection in Europe Yet again the media reports maltreatment of animals in the Member States .
Subject : Radioactive pollution of the Aegean and Ionian Seas According to reports in the Greek press , as well as in the Turkish press , according to &apos; Le Journal du Dimanche &apos; , depleted uranium shells have been used by the Greek and the Turkish navies in exercises in the Aegean and the Ionian Seas for the last ten years .
Mr President , this is my third vote against the request of a European Union State for a directive : this time , the subject is the mutual recognition of decisions to expel third - country citizens .
I would like to thank you very much for preparing a subject which at first seems very technical , but which , as you quite rightly stressed , has a very substantial part to play in creating a citizens &apos; Europe , because cross-border business is on the increase .
Subject : Bringing the citizens of Europe closer to the decision makers What progress has the Council Presidency made with my suggestion , which it seemed to welcome at its meeting with committee chairmen in Brussels earlier this month , for the President - in - Office to make an EU- wide television broadcast at the end of each six - month presidency and report to the citizens of Europe on the progress made ?
Subject : Passports for Swedes travelling within the Nordic region From 25 March 2001 , Sweden and the other Nordic countries will take part in Schengen cooperation .
The issue is of fundamental importance for the correct functioning of the European single market and I would like to thank colleagues for raising the subject this time given the number of cases the Commission has referred to the Court of Justice over recent years .
Abandoning wider subjects and , in general terms , a wider education in favour of skills which will make them employable deprives children - especially children from working class homes - of the rudimentary knowledge they need in order to function as active , thinking citizens and , as factors of social progress .
The question is , how motherly should the European Union be in the quest to protect itself from its subjects ?
Mr President , Commissioner , the problem of cheap labour from elsewhere versus more costly labour carried out by EU subjects has , in connection with the pending enlargement , been in the news rather a lot in the last few weeks , and with good reason .
This too is the reason why in every political or professional discussion on the subject of economic and legal reforms I stand up as an advocate of the reforms , even though I always view them in terms of their benefits for the majority of our citizens .
Subject : Political dialogue meetings with Turkey In its answer to written question P-0054 / 01 , the Council stated that Turkey would &apos; remove any legal provisions forbidding the use by Turkish citizens of their mother tongue in TV / radio broadcasting ( short - term ) &apos; .
Subject : Recording of details of members of the public in the SIS register in connection with the demonstrations in Malmö Demonstrations critical of the EU and EMU took place when the ECOFIN Council met in Malmö in April .
However , these essential regional planning measures have to be the subject of debate with the elected representatives and citizens concerned , because they are the ones who have to live with the coastline on a day - to - day basis , and it is absolutely essential to involve them in this protection if we want it to be admired and respected .
Does the Minister see any chance of a debate on this subject being held within the Council and within European institutions , so that we can reassure citizens regarding democratic monitoring of what is , after all , an important police service , although still in an embryonic state ?

In a Europe whose citizens share the same fundamental values , but may have differences of opinion on certain subjects , it is specifically via the excellence of the European Parliament that the democratic confrontation between opinions should operate .
Enlargement itself , the subject of so much praise and emphasis , is , on the contrary , seen by the citizens as a weakening rather than a strengthening of Europe .

A loyal subject of Christ ’ s kingdom must take a course like that of men of pre - Christian times , such as Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , who , although they did not receive the Kingdom promises during their lives , “ saw them afar off and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land . ”
Among them one can prepare himself by a serious study to learn what is required of him as a subject of that kingdom .

Patients should be subjects , not the objects of a marketing campaign .
Only subject C selling the final goods to the consumer pays VAT .
The crux of this is that subject B is not taxed at all although the basis of his business is to buy low and sell high .
Therefore , it is being proposed that subject B should pay VAT on the price difference to the state &apos; s treasury .

“ Said therefore to him — Pilate : Not really a king &#91; predicate &#93; art &#91; verb &#93; thou &#91; subject &#93; ?

on behalf of the PPE - DE Group . - Mr President , we seem to be a succession of old hands rising to speak , but would that I were not making my last speech in the European Parliament in the worst economic situation of my lifetime - and that is a lifetime that started in the blighted 1930s - and would that I were not also having to speak in a debate on a piece of European legislation which is not , I am afraid , wholly satisfactory : the Capital Requirements Directive .

Remarkable as are the achievements of modern surgery , I agree , as a Christian minister as well as a surgeon , with Jesus Christ that spiritual values come ahead of material or physical ones .

I see three main problems : the first is obviously language , a point that has been raised ; the second is the complexity of the procedures to be followed to have a person &apos; s qualifications recognised as valid - at times , people have to literally jump through hoops to have their initial diplomas recognised ; and the third is perhaps the variety of types of initial training .
The third is the virulence of the crisis and its challenges and , despite this , the exasperating slowness of the response and decision - making mechanisms that are typical of the European Union .

My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the Commission is ready to do so , we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens .

Mr President , Commissioner , as my time is limited , I shall get straight to the point .

It might well be asked , Is it honest to cite such texts that speak of the rage of the king as examples to prove that the book of Proverbs could not have been written during Solomon ’ s time , and ignore texts that speak of his favor and loving - kindness , which texts are even more numerous ? — Prov .

And I know a little bit about these issues , because , for many years , I spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex , and I &apos; m a recovering executive director , two years clean .

I even recovered industrial waste from a mountain which had been designated as a household waste tip and we also saw an out - of - order incinerator , or at least what appeared to be one .
These two groups differ significantly in weight , which means that electrical waste makes the collection rate higher , while electronic waste , which is rich in gold , silver and rare earth metals , often ends up on rubbish tips .
The Commission only states that the regional and local authorities can play a role , but we have some good examples of effective cooperation between the authorities and companies in the area of waste processing , which , in the cases of Copenhagen , has meant a very significant reduction in construction waste and has also resulted in planned disposal tips being unused .
The final disposal of waste at waste tips is the least advantageous solution , since it is both seen and noticed , apart from its impact on the environment .
At the end of all this the Commission will shortly produce a new proposal on waste tips .
It consigns Essex to remain the waste - tip for London , it underestimates the potential for recycling by half , it threatens areas of natural beauty close to people &apos; s homes and to schools and sites of historic interest .

Taxi drivers are customarily paid based on the meter and at times are given tips , particularly if they drove through a dangerous neighborhood or late at night .
Generally the custom is to give a tip as an expression of gratitude for good service and a friendly attitude .
This kind of tip is looked upon as a “ small reward for services rendered . ”
Unfortunately , in neighboring Austria — according to Lowell , a frequent traveler living in Luxembourg — German guests have a reputation for leaving very small tips or none at all .
Usually the bill does not include a service charge , in which case 8 to 10 percent should be added as a tip .
Even if the service charge is included , however , it is still common to add a tip of up to 5 percent .
“ Tips are very essential , ” he says , because “ wages are quite low . ”
He believes he has earned his tip when he shows his customer courtesy and speed of service .
Taxi drivers in Japan are paid a fixed wage that is sufficient to support a family , and they are not allowed to solicit tips .

While a bribe is given to pervert justice or for other dishonest purposes , a tip is an expression of appreciation for services rendered .
Should a Christian give a government employee a tip or a gift for his services , or would that be viewed as bribery ?
But is it bribery to give a gift or a tip to , say , a public servant in order to obtain a legitimate service or to avoid unfair treatment ?
For example , in some lands officials may be unwilling to enroll children in school , admit a person into a hospital , or stamp immigration documents until they receive a tip .
On the other hand , when making legitimate requests , some of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses have declined to give tips to inspectors , customs officials , or others even where such gift - giving is routine .
In summary , each servant of Jehovah must decide for himself whether he will extend a tip to receive a legitimate service or to avoid unfair treatment .
• Should a Christian give a government employee a tip or some type of gift for his services ?
But it is not bribery to give a tip or a gift to a public servant when he performs his duty or to obtain a legitimate service or to avoid unfair treatment . — 4 / 1 , page 29 .

The next Stauner report was in the same hysterical tone as the first round but this time we were ready for her .

However , I must say , Madam President - in - Office , as there has perhaps been a degree of friction over recent weeks , which is quite understandable and perfectly usual in politics , that I expressly acknowledge and respect the tone and atmosphere which you brought to this morning &apos; s debate .
I have taken good note of what she said and furthermore I would like to thank her publicly - because I raised the question at the previous plenary session - for the fact that Parliament has finally been incorporated into the statement of 7 March , something which did not happen initially , and that you have amended the letter that you sent us which had rather too much of a tone of the secretariat of the Council , including annexes .

This month , the film crew has put together an update together with an early trailer of the film :
This trailer is for The Hunger Game , a 15 minute film by Félix Álvarez Torres from Perú , where he establishes that food prices are played with as if they were gambling chips in a game of power .
Following , the original motion picture trailer for One Day on Earth .
&quot; The trailer , for an apparently fake movie called &quot; &quot; He Who Doesn ’ t Understand Will Understand Soon , &quot; &quot; mostly features Kadyrov firing an automatic weapon into the air . &quot;
Watch the trailer for “ A Siege of Salt and Sand ”
&quot; And most of what you see -- that &apos; s a trailer from &quot; &quot; Women Are Heroes &quot; &quot; -- its images , photography , taken one after the other . &quot;
On a request from the Council of Ministers , the Commission has worked on a proposal to include passenger vehicles in Directive 96 / 53 , not only in order to harmonise the length of rigid buses but also to create a clearer situation regarding removable attachments on buses and trailers .
At the request of the Council of Ministers , the Commission has drawn up a proposal seeking to include passenger vehicles in Council Directive 96 / 53 / EC in order to harmonise not only the length of rigid buses but also to create a clearer situation regarding removable attachments on buses and trailers .
With the second amendment , the European Parliament proposes the same length of 18.75 metres for articulated buses , as for buses with trailers .
We are creating a provision for trailers on motor vehicles .
Often the trailer ’ s registration number is known but not that of the motor vehicle , and then it is very difficult to settle a claim .
Trailers , independently of their weight , are already expressly covered by the insurance directives within the definition of vehicles and are therefore subject to compulsory insurance .
Access should only be given to data concerning vehicles with a cylinder capacity above 55 cc , and data concerning trailers and caravans with an unladen weight exceeding 750 kg .
Are we able to ensure that the lorry I referred to or the trailer in other types of transport can move around as freely as possible and at the least cost in this form of transport and transfer in ports , with costs that are truly justified and not artificial such as , for example , the one to which I have referred ?
I hope the dispute over &apos; vehicle and trailer &apos; issues does not stop this being adopted without need for conciliation .
I am delighted that the trailer problem has been resolved .
The provisions relating to trailers and motor caravans improve control without increasing burdens .
Finally , I am pleased about the introduction of extra possibilities for drivers with a category &apos; B &apos; licence to tow heavy trailers .
The whole basis of technical regulation for motor vehicles was one of the earliest areas of harmonisation within the European single market , but it has taken until now for us to have a fully comprehensive type - approval framework for all categories of motor vehicles , trailers , major component systems and critical components .
( DE ) Madam President , Mr Vice - President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , tomorrow you will be voting on an important new directive on the type approval of cars , lorries , buses and their trailers .
The new directive extends the European type approval , that has hitherto only been foreseen for passenger cars , to lorries , buses and their trailers .
The only exceptions were commercial vehicles , that is buses , lorries and their trailers , despite the fact that this is a sector of huge economic importance .
in writing . - ( PT ) Although this is a codification procedure that does not alter existing legislation in any way , the underlying question raised is the need for a set of Community directives on a set of issues concerning tractors and other motor vehicles and their trailers , as can be seen from the codified version of several reports put to the vote in Parliament today .
At European level , we are facing in the automotive manufacturing industry similar situations in Sweden , where 2 258 workers have been made redundant , in Austria , where 774 redundancies have been made in companies manufacturing motor vehicles , trailers and semi-trailers , and in Belgium , where the industry has made more than 2 500 employees redundant .
Secondly , there are the restrictions relating to all the conditions , the never - ending reporting requested from farmers for everything they do : taking a trailer full of manure to a field , using a dose of fertiliser in another field , using a dose of plant protection product in a third field , and if they make a mistake , they are sanctioned .
Consequently , the provisions laid down in Directive 2003 / 37 / EC relating to agricultural and forestry tractors , their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery , together with their systems , components and separate technical units , apply to this directive .
Directive 76 / 432 / EEC is one of the separate directives of the EC type - approval system provided for in Council Directive 74 / 150 / EEC , as replaced by Directive 2003 / 37 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type - approval of agricultural or forestry tractors , their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery , together with their systems , components and separate technical units , and repealing Directive 74 / 150 / EEC , and lays down technical prescriptions concerning braking devices .
Consequently , the provisions laid down in Directive 2003 / 37 / EC relating to agricultural or forestry tractors , their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery , together with their systems , components and separate technical units , apply to this directive .
We can not accept Amendment No 2 because trailers are definitely not covered by these provisions .
I am very pleased that from now on each Member State will recognize the evidence provided by another Member State that a motor vehicle registered in the latter , together with its trailer or semi-trailer , has successfully passed a roadworthiness test that fully complies with the provisions of the present Directive .
My report , now at the codecision stage , on the inspection of motor vehicles and their trailers also took that approach .
Significant progress has already been made , particularly in terms of having more standardized dimensions and maximum lighterage for vehicles and their trailers .
As to the matter itself : we support the draft directive from the Commission on the harmonization of the registration documentation for motor vehicles and trailers .
Amendment No 10 provides for wagons and trailers to be included under &apos; vehicle refinishing &apos; , a clause that will be easier for professionals to apply and is just as effective in terms of results .
We are firmly of the opinion that this proposal represents an important step forward in the approximation of Member States &apos; legislation on liquid - fuel tanks and rear underrun protection of motor vehicles and their trailers . The approval of vehicles with regard to the prevention of fire risk , particularly for fuel tanks made of plastic material of category MI vehicles will therefore be more rational .
These are transported to and from the docks by means of specially designed railroad flatcars , as well as low trailers towed by truck .
In northern Europe and Scandinavia , where sea gulfs separate land areas , truck - trailer transport on ships was adopted over fifteen years ago .
The advantage , of course , is that when the goods are once loaded into the trailer , they do not have to be moved again .
When not inflated , the entire balloon can fit into a small trailer that is towed behind my car .
Give me a hand pulling the basket and balloon from the trailer , and we ’ ll spread it out on the ground to prepare for inflation .

Those are long prime movers that tow three or four trailers and measure up to 180 feet &#91; 55 m &#93; in overall length .
And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 - wheeler trailer , and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples .
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we &apos; re building schools out of these days .
The Secretary - General of the Council has published a collection of documents covering the entire Schengen acquis , pending publication in the Official Journal once all the translations are available .
This collection is , at present , available in six languages and the remaining translations are nearing completion .
When implementation of the programme begins , I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full .
And , again , I urge you , Madam President , to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently .
Amendment No 33 is ambiguous regarding &apos; the language &apos; of the guest member state , especially when there are various official languages , and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages .
I also want to mention the translation problems , of which I will give just one example , as we do not have much time .
Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts .
We shall address this problem and check all the translations .
. ( DE ) Madam President , I have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification , because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations .
Madam President , I would like , with reference to this report , to underline the problem of translation : reference should be made to the French or Italian version , since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the authoritative one for the Commission .

Yet , in history , rarely has the trust of so many people been as badly shattered as in our time .
So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community , let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days .
And the problem with it is , I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system , where we take a system that &apos; s basically built on trust , was basically built for a smaller - scale system , and we &apos; ve kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate .
The basis of human trust is established through play signals .
One of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field .
Here &apos; s one more secret for you : Shaking someone &apos; s hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream , now that &apos; s the trust hormone .

There &apos; s a lot to be said about trust and love , if you know that those two words are synonymous for design .
It &apos; s true that the trust and the love , that makes it worthwhile .
Elinor Ostrom , the latest Nobel laureate of economics , clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust , local , action - based partnerships and cross -scale institutional innovations , where local actors , together , can deal with the global commons at a large scale .
There &apos; s a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .

Feeling like the world is becoming less friendly ? Social theorist Jonathan Zittrain begs to difffer . The Internet , he suggests , is made up of millions of disinterested acts of kindness , curiosity and trust .
People are less kind . There is less trust around .
This is a system that relies on kindness and trust , which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable .
The reality , unfortunately , is a little different , and it has a lot to do with trust , or a lack of it .
And since we had established some trust , we believed in each other &apos; s sincerity .
&quot; Now speaking of trust , ever since I wrote this book , &quot; &quot; Liespotting , &quot; &quot; no one wants to meet me in person anymore , no , no , no , no , no . &quot;
&quot; Conductor Charles Hazlewood talks about the role of trust in musical leadership -- then shows how it works , as he conducts the Scottish Ensemble onstage . He also shares clips from two musical projects : the opera &quot; &quot; U- Carmen eKhayelitsha &quot; &quot; and the ParaOrchestra . &quot;
I am a conductor , and I &apos; m here today to talk to you about trust .
Instead of moving towards the development of a Community external service which is completely independent from those of the Member States , which would give rise to considerable extra costs , particularly as regards training , pointless redundancies and inevitable conflicting responsibilities , the sensible thing to do would be to make use , at Community level , of the experience acquired in a bilateral context , particularly in the aid and cooperation service , the competence and expertise available within the national external services , and their familiarity with the diplomatic practices of their members .
Our development interventions and changes in land use , the crops we choose to farm and the farming methods we apply , even the way in which we create demand and habits in our daily life , have helped to tip the balance in nature .
With regard to the SAB 3 / 99 , Mr President , there are two cases , which are not of that type which we have often criticised in the Committee on Budgets for the use and abuse of the supplementary and amending budgets , but which I believe are well justified cases .

The use of idols in worship is surprisingly widespread .
Not only is Christendom ’ s manufacture and use of images disapproved by God , but even her most sacred days are linked with customs that are rooted in false religion .
If you have a sense of urgency , a desire to make the best use of your time , regression will be discouraged .
More elaborate religious observances , as well as the use of temples , statues , and images , were later introduced by the Etruscans .
Part of this research incorporates the use of sophisticated electronic tags that reveal vital data about the habits and health of tuna schools .
Since the Israelites were accustomed to swearing by God ’ s name , whether in court or on some other occasion , it follows that this commandment also forbade the false use of God ’ s name .
This is a bad habit that brings dishonor , not only to the one who is addicted to its use , but also to Jehovah God , the Creator of the tongue .
The apostle Paul also made good use of the custom of reading the Scriptures in the synagogue .
In Thessalonica , “ according to &#91; his &#93; custom , ” Paul made use of a Jewish synagogue and “ for three sabbaths he reasoned with &#91; the Jews &#93; from the Scriptures . ”
For example , in ancient times some Jews chose to ignore the inspired Scriptures in favor of tradition that called for avoiding the use of God ’ s name .
If any Jews were already avoiding the use of God ’ s name during the time of Jesus ’ ministry , Jesus would certainly not have followed their tradition .
Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest , practise , develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions , customs and ceremonies ; the right to maintain , protect and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites ; the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects ; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains .

Another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services , electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet , when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds .
Finally , as the committee representing energy , we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more , thus , through a process of coordination , increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums .
Finally , in this time of natural disasters , I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds .
To this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the Structural Funds .
Firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
That way the much - trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform .
I shall not list them all , but they include implementing intersectoral policies , increasing efficiency in the use of public funds , assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together , etc . The Commission takes note of these , but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents , such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document .
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned , permitting greater use of Community law , which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply .
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous : the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another , with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU .
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience , make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials , work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea .

It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament , nor to the majority of the trade unions , who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration , but , in practice , are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members , putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use .
As regards SIS , the Schengen Information System , I am pleased to report that the Member States were very positive about its operation and use .
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions , criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings , economic exploitation of immigrants , and sexual exploitation of woman and children , with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication , notably the Internet , for distributing child pornography .
However , the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years .
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use .
Quite the opposite , in an enlarged Europe , Mr President , the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding .

And aid agencies themselves are increasingly making use of advanced technology : geographic information systems , Skype , biometric databases and Google Earth , to give just a few examples .
For instance many argue that such a policy would be offset by increased HIV risk behaviour , such as reduced condom use or increased numbers of sex partners .
However , the use of these creams is not safe : stretch marks , pimples , hair , hypertension and diabetes are all risks user take .
Most of these netizens write on LiveJournal , though there is an increasing use of Twitter and Facebook .

In view of the hazards of modern drug therapy it is understandable why many countries have now set up government organizations that supervise the introduction and use of drugs , as well as publish warnings and recommend withdrawal of a drug where necessary .
What would be the proper outlook toward the use of such pills ?

There was good reason to believe the scientists were all astray as to the use of the papyrus craft too .
In recent years the harsh consequences of the heavy use of pesticides have become evident .
Because DDT has turned up in milk , meat , vegetables , fruit and people , government officials in the United States placed strict limits on its use after January 1 , 1970 .
How widespread is the use of these additives today ?
Several other countries followed the United States and banned the use of cyclamates .
Would it therefore not be mere sensible to keep the use of these additives to the absolute minimum until such time as all shadow of doubt as to their safety has vanished ?
While it is impossible in much of the world today to avoid them altogether since their use is so widespread and very often hidden from view , you can apply the suggestions on the chart on page 7 .
Also , Jehovah directed his ancient people of Israel on the use of money that had been set aside for a certain purpose : “ You must also give the money for whatever your soul may crave in the way of cattle and sheep and goats and wine and intoxicating liquor and anything that your soul may ask of you ; and you must eat there before Jehovah your God and rejoice . ”

Here &apos; s your brute force approach . Once you get through your brute force approach , then you just rip off whole mountaintops . And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions , which are coal -fired gas plants . That is probably not the best use of bioenergy .
And both in the production of plastic , the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic , the people who have the bull &apos; s - eye on their foreheads are poor people .
Poor people also suffer at the point of use .
And the strength , extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response , have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications , for example , as a component of artificial tendons , for serving as guides to regrow nerves , and for scaffolds for tissue growth .
One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan is the use of Indian cheap labor that they import from India to build the roads , and then they send these people home once the roads are built .
But the science that &apos; s coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own .
It took the Senate just 17 days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage .
And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America , and that is my DNA over here , because that person who I grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever .
A public health survey analyzed the effect that large - scale Tamiflu use would have , actually shows it counteractive to public health measures , making matters worse .
The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery .
&quot; The other thing is , that a piece of evidence is , is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide , what you find there , and it &apos; s quite interesting , is use of the first person singular -- &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my , &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; us &quot; &quot; -- and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone . &quot;
So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapidly , horizontally across the population , or was transmitted vertically , down the generations .
A mole &apos; s software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use .
Also , the reference to Gerhard Richter &apos; s use of color charts -- and the idea also entering another realm of representation that &apos; s very common to us today , which is the bit map .
However , according to prison statistics , the majority of drug users in prison are economic migrants who , either because they do not speak the language or because of a lack of information and social exclusion , have never set foot in such a centre .
We all know that using drugs leads to crime , not only because drugs per se are illegal , but because the high cost of drugs set by the huge financial rings which supply them , inevitably forces all users into crime .
In Amendment No 37 , the idea that we will not focus on the prosecution of addicts is broadened to also include users .
In my view , it is not for the report to comment on this but , rather , up to the Member States to decide on the policy they generally wish to enforce , or resume enforcing , where users are concerned .
This not about marginalising drug users still further , nor about scuppering risk reduction schemes , but about demonstrating at last the will to undertake preventive measures , which must have a simultaneous effect on both supply and demand and on our sense of social responsibility .
Prohibition denies drug users the information about content that is available to everyone who enjoys an alcohol drink in the evening .
We should also be making better use of the experiences of former drug users in the information we provide in places like schools and community centres .
I support the rapporteur because she wants to use the experiences of former drugs users and wants to ensure the provision of advice , support , health care and more opportunities to help people get rid of their addictions .
My conclusion is , therefore , that lumping all drugs and drugs users together will not provide a solution .
With regard to drug use in prisons , the Centre indicates that drug users are over-represented in prison ; that the use of drugs among detainees ranges from 22 to 86 % , depending on the prison population , the prison and the country ; and that prisons are a high - risk environment for the spread of infectious diseases .
Should we , for example , provide needles to drug users who live on the streets ?
Since then , policy in a number of states has been aimed at isolating , criminalising , penalising and eliminating drug users .
By adopting a more liberalised stance on drugs , we could help drug users deal with their sickness and at the same time eliminate drug traffickers .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , AIDS is still an ongoing tragedy , not only in developing countries , but also in Europe , not only among homosexuals and drug users , but also among heterosexuals and the totally abstinent , and so I should like to extend warm thanks to our rapporteur .
We must take the reality of women , young people , sex workers and drug users seriously , and that reality is what we need to take as a basis .
I wish to take this opportunity to home in on just one aspect : infection due to the use of infected needles by drug - users .
It consists of NGOs , women &apos; s groups , groups for men who have sex with men , sex workers , prisoners , drug users .
We must be clear that this report and the action programme itself are not about combating the trade in drugs , but about the public health aspects of the drugs problem , and our guiding principle here must be that a humane , tolerant and pragmatic approach - and I see that even as I speak Mrs Oomen - Ruijten is leaving the Chamber , which is a great pity - is a more effective means of prevention than treating drugs users harshly and repressively .
I hope that the adoption of this programme will in due course support , relaunch and act as a catalyst for common efforts to prevent drug dependence and to help drug users .
If the problem is not tackled seriously , the drug users fraternity , as a result of the existence of synthetic drugs , will extend to those outside the so - called marginalized group .
Dilemmas such as whether or not to legalise hard and soft drugs are disorienting , dangerous and false , because reality is always harsh , both for drug users and for society , which always ends up paying the high price .
I would stress that all the amendments which I have examined , in particular my own and that of Ana Palacio , sought to remind this House that drug - users do not need prison but need alternative penalties , for example recovery in the community or in specialised centres .
Thirdly , drugs users should be able to test drugs for their content and mixture .
Users tend to center their lives around their own pleasure , frequently showing a general disregard for others .
The situation with drug use seems to be that the user thinks he is better than ever , but he really is not .
The answer is simple : Users , break the habit , dry up the market , and in one fell swoop kill the whole evil business .
He adds : “ Today there are an estimated 190 million drug users around the world .
Although drug users may be in the minority , their numbers are sufficient to grant immense power to the drug barons , the men who organize the production and distribution of drugs .
Indeed , some 22 percent of the world ’ s HIV - positive population are drug users who injected themselves with infected needles .
But more than the health of the user is affected .
Drug users make the streets unsafe in other ways .
Contamination begins when notes are handled by drug users .
Those most at risk of contracting the disease are intravenous drug users who share needles and people who engage in unprotected sex .
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has increased support to “ harm reduction programmes ” for injecting drug users .
( c ) Training health - care providers in all areas of HIV / AIDS and sexually transmitted infections prevention and control , and giving special attention to the avoidance of contaminating equipment and blood products , the need to ensure safe blood supply and the avoidance of reusing or sharing needles among injecting drug users ;
State interference in the economy is , even today , still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers .
If this &apos; feedback &apos; mechanism , which gives users the opportunity to make choices , were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax , mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it .
Also , Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2 a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such , thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions .
The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user , the consumer .
It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers , millions of service users , in a great rush .
Instead of fighting amongst themselves , public postal services should cooperate , take staff on and guarantee decent , stable working conditions , while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services .
Experience in other sectors show a sort of U- curve pattern : a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place , as , of course , the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive ; then a second phase of steady employment , as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions ; finally , a third phase of net job creation , both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly .
The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments , especially the French government , is a retrograde policy , counter to the interests of both the service users , i.e. the great majority of the population , and the postal service workers .
And although it may be true that we have to encourage web - site administrators and service providers to define their standards of conduct and to regulate themselves , and encourage Internet users to inform the authorities whenever they discover child pornography , it is nevertheless true that Union and national law bear some responsibility .
Without this qualification , users &apos; surfing &apos; the Internet and inadvertently accessing a site displaying child pornography would also be punishable .
Users of child pornography must be punished severely to serve as examples .
We need all citizens to be involved and to be vigilant , not just police forces through Europol , and public authorities , but also Internet users and the economic network producers , in order to be able to identify the people who use these electronic messages .
The extra cost involved will obviously be passed on to the user , who will pay more for their airline tickets .
The user should be fully aware of the actual costs of flying , including all environmental costs .
We must come to a rapid decision so that we can finally offer the users on this market a legal framework , even if , as the rapporteur rightly pointed out , it may not be perfect in every way and may still have a number of weaknesses .
The huge sums paid will not come out of the companies &apos; profits ; they will be paid for by users .
In future , it is incumbent on the Commission to ensure more vigorously than ever that the &apos; roaming &apos; fees charged to users by operators are brought down in all EU countries to a sensible level based on actual costs .
The operators are not allowed to collect fees from the users , but neither must the public authority collect from the operators .
We as regulators should at least try to practise damage limitation . We should compel producers to make the warnings to users as clear as possible .
Interoperability of the set - top boxes is intended to avoid a situation where before long , users are having to place a whole assortment of boxes on top of their digital TVs in order to continue to watch the various programmes .
Moreover , I would argue that there should also be great focus on the interoperability of systems which , although its aim is general protection of the possibility for users to access the data broadcast via the digital platforms , is emerging at this time as a competition protection measure , protecting the possibility of access to the market for the different operators and thus opening up unprecedented legal horizons .
As far as ordinary users are concerned , gas and electricity have become goods that one can either afford or not .
Will users in the not too distant future be asked to pay for their electricity in advance , as is the case in Great Britain , and be forced to go without when their card runs out ?
Facebook users today posted links to a video shot at what is alleged to be the private zoo of oligarch MP Gagik Tsarukian .
We , the bloggers , will promote a world in which Internet users shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and repression in any form .
Internet users are exchanging links to YouTube , showing the extent of the damage , via email .
&quot; Indonesian internet users are on the move to save the internet from &quot; &quot; repressive &quot; &quot; regulations crafted by the Ministry of Communication and Information ( Depkominfo ) . &quot;
Mczarny follows up on the comments of users who claim that high traffic on main search engines is due to simple curiosity about the accident :
&quot; Another Twitter user , @ HaitiRewired , posted a link directing tweeple to &quot; &quot; some really interesting and informed conversation about hybrid seeds in Haiti &quot; &quot; . &quot;
SOIT warns that this way Facebook should also be blocked completely , because it allows users to play online roulette and poker .

By 1980 , users hoped , her production would rise to about 20,000,000 barrels a day .
In any event , the speculator says , somebody must own the grain after it leaves the farmer ’ s hands and before it reaches the actual user .
According to Time magazine , Zolty demanded that the hotel “ use only automated equipment and non - Jewish employees to heat food and wash dishes on Saturdays ; abolish Saturday checkout except for emergencies ; and program hotel elevators on the Sabbath so that Jewish users will not have to push floor buttons . ”
This means that users can be given almost instant access to volumes of information .
Nearby are finished systems on which new software can be tested and new users trained .
Complicated controls , awkward mounting locations , and driving with one hand are listed as the main hazards for users .
While high - ranking police officials are said to endorse the use of the car phone , they are calling on users to make calls only “ when safe to do so . ”
One manufacturer of the software that makes this surveillance possible says : “ It permits total surveillance of all users , all of the time . ”
Along with this , it is programmed in such a way that it can guide a user to the precise information he needs with a minimum of time and effort .
The user “ communicates ” with the expert system through a keyboard and video screen or some other device .
And that &apos; s very important , the user interface .
These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
But what &apos; s cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that &apos; s something that I &apos; ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system .
Here &apos; s more data , traffic survey data , again , put out by the U.K. government , and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards , then a user could just make a map , just by clicking .
But instead of saying , we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once they &apos; re uploaded , Flickr simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos .
And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm , sort of glowing kind of mood light , all the way to a bright work light .
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business , value to the users also , but I think it &apos; s the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value .
The packaging , and the website , and you need to continue to really touch the user , in many ways .
And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
It will be worked out in use , in collaboration with users .
The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big , disruptive innovations .
&quot; No , what you do , is you go in and you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos; ve got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users , and I can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
They &apos; ve got so much sunk in it that it &apos; s very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets . Emerging new markets , then , are the breeding grounds for passionate users .
And one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers , consumers into designers .
And of course , by building quick prototypes , we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if we ’ re trying to describe them through words .
The Lego guys don &apos;t give you any royalties , strangely , but some user made this and then it sold .
&quot; He &apos; s obviously not Joanne -- so we &apos; ll &quot; &quot; add user . &quot; &quot; &quot;
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user .
Or they &apos; re responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many , or most , of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question .
In plain English , that means censorship and surveillance of their users .
And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way , without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior .
And when it &apos; s expired , using failsafe technology , the system will shut off , protecting the user .
So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do .
Both ferries that cover a distance of more than 500 metres - the provisions will no longer apply to ferries covering shorter distances - and sight - seeing tours and excursions play an important role in the tourist industry , together , especially , with historic vessels .
The Danish Social Democrats would also like to see the transport of goods and passengers switched from catamaran ferries and other fast - moving craft to more environmentally friendly vessels .
Vessels constructed out of reeds were in use by American Indians along the Pacific coast from California to Chile at the time the Spaniards arrived .
But surely the most important rule is No. 2 , which states : “ Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel or owner , master or crew thereof , from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these rules or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen , or by the special circumstances of the case . ”
Legislation makes it illegal for persons under fifteen years of age to drive any vessel capable of exceeding ten knots under power .
They must not exceed five knots when within 200 yards ( 180 meters ) of the shore or when passing within 100 feet ( 30 meters ) of other vessels or any person bathing or fishing .
One person is told to build a vessel for preservation .
My work has involved designing vessels of various shapes and sizes , along with the mechanical and other systems that propel them .
The manner in which vessels respond to wind and waves is called seakeeping behavior .
Extreme pitching — when each wave lifts one end of the vessel and then allows it to plunge downward — would have been very uncomfortable for the people and animals on board .
Like the fly boats , they had priority over other craft and , on the Bridgewater Canal , carried a large blade mounted on the bow to cut through the tow rope of any other vessel that got in the way !
That &apos; s the vessel that we took up there for these studies , early on , and that &apos; s what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background .
In Vila Garcia de Arousa , repositories have been installed in a wharf financed by the ERDF to hold 80 000 cubic metres of hydrocarbons , which pose a serious threat to fishing and related activities which provide jobs for 18 000 people , if these hydrocarbons are handled on a regular basis or if accidents with transporting vessels occur .

Then cover the vessel and wrap it in a blanket or keep it in a warm place , about 110 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit , for from four to six hours or overnight .
It is also important that you do not disturb the vessel while the fermenting process is at work or the milk may not set .
When the blocked vessel is in the heart , it is called a coronary thrombosis , or a coronary occlusion .
If the blocked vessel is a major one that supplies nourishing blood to a large section of the heart , the resulting death of muscle tissue usually causes the heart to stop — it is a fatal heart attack .
It seems that in such cases the heart needs more blood to meet some physical or emotional emergency , and the blood reaching it through the narrowed vessels proves inadequate .
His presence was comforting to me , as was the knowledge that his sucking action was causing the uterus to contract , thereby closing off severed vessels to protect me from excessive bleeding .

Now , combine that with another principle at First Peter , chapter 3 , verse 7 , which shows that a husband who serves God must consider his wife ’ s physical and emotional makeup , and , as it says , must ‘ assign her honor ’ yes , “ honor , ” ‘ as to a weaker vessel , the feminine one . ’
We read : “ This man is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations as well as to kings and the sons of Israel . ”
Atherosclerosis does not cause a uniform narrowing of the vessels .
So the clot occurs at a narrowed part of a vessel , blocking the blood flow to a portion of the heart muscle .
The arteries supplying blood to our muscles become narrower in size , and many small vessels even disappear .
So when a pulse of blood comes down , the vessel can ’ t expand ( to ease its passage ) .
We were going to have to slice through many of those vessels , and there was going to be massive hemorrhaging .

Although vessels as small as one third of a millimeter ( 0.0130 inch ) are joined in reversing male vasectomies , one study showed a 90 - percent restoration , with early pregnancy of the spouse in half of the case histories .
By using this , instead of directly viewing the patient , the microsurgeon ( and usually his assistant as well ) gains an enlarged stereoscopic view of the tiny vessels and other body parts that must be joined together .

The “ Weaker Vessel ” — An Insult to Women ?
DOES the Bible expression “ weaker vessel ” degrade women ?
The Bible verse in question is 1 Peter 3 : 7 , which states : “ You husbands , continue dwelling in like manner with them according to knowledge , assigning them honor as to a weaker vessel , the feminine one , since you are also heirs with them of the undeserved favor of life , in order for your prayers not to be hindered . ”
How would first - century readers of Peter ’ s words construe the term “ weaker vessel ” ?
Therefore , the early Christians would not have considered the term “ weaker vessel ” to be derogatory to women .
Is the second vessel somehow less valued because it is not as sturdy ?
Peter uses the term “ weaker vessel , ” not to denigrate women , but to foster respect .

Immediately after referring to women as the “ weaker vessel , ” Peter ’ s words continue : “ Since you are also heirs with them of the undeserved favor of life , in order for your prayers not to be hindered . ”
In no way is the term “ weaker vessel ” meant to insult women .

In my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based , rationally argued and fully justified .
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard .
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views , I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe .

My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add - on .
Secondly , in my view , while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential .
We could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package .

When I enter into dialogue , I really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view , that I would impress upon them my opinions and my values .
Well the root of this problem , in my view , is the idea of disposability itself .

It &apos; s an accelerated view , where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process .

The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation .
In this first speech , I would like to share with Parliament the Commission &apos; s view of the most important events in 1999 .

How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view , as this will have important implications , notably for the accession negotiations and for our country , which shares common borders with so many applicant countries ?
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal , since she has contributed , in collaboration with the other Members , to the achievement of a very reasonable final result , which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and , of course , on what , from a budgetary point of view , the Council had initially accepted .
Furthermore , behind these programmes , that is to say , the SAVE programme , which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings , and the Altener programme , which concerns renewable energy , there lies an extremely important technological challenge , which , from an economic point of view , may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole .
Mr President , most of the time , the European Parliament , spearheaded by environment committees , does it s very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council , so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view .
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned , I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy , which means , in our view , that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , in my view , this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses .
Mr President , Commissioner , at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which , from an agronomic point of view , and since I come from a southern country , I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive .
In my view , however , the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too .
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues , and whether or not it agrees with this initiative , this is in any case legitimate from this point of view .

In my view , it is the task of the European Union to employ all instruments , including this one , so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means .
We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region , we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed , emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union , and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south - east Europe , and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability .
From the point of view of the Macedonian majority , the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict .

This view is shared by most netizens in Turkmenistan who believe that media freedoms and human rights in general are nothing but &apos; fiction &apos; in the Caspian state .
Hundreds of other bloggers and activists who have used various social media websites to express their views have been imprisoned as a result .
Marwan , one of the youths who paused to swim while his family were making the trek to Molyvos , gestures to the crowds of exhausted , patience - worn - thin fellow travelers around them at the port and says wryly , “ If I knew we were hurrying only to get stuck here I would have stayed in the sea for longer and stopped to admire the views along the way ” .

A system of cognitive processes , largely non-conscious cognitive processes , that help them change their views of the world , so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves .
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made , we , the European Parliament , would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas , as well as its lack of common vision and , in particular , the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament .
Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day - to - day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole . In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society , all of which are described , with no form of hierarchy , as &apos; integral elements of European governance &apos; .
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious .

Madam President , the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision , as a European , of the Basque Country , Spain and Europe .
It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision .
I do not feel that the European Parliament &apos; s intervention in this matter is abusive or excessive , but rather that it is a step towards guaranteeing the realisation of the concept , the vision of balanced European justice , especially with regard to the proper functioning of the public authorities .
This way of thinking is fundamentally different from our own vision of a European Community .
Rather than this concept , I prefer the universalist vision of a republican Europe in which each individual as such fully and actively exercises his rights and freedoms .
If the Council intends to finance actions in the Balkans at the expense of current external or agricultural policies , it would not only be showing a lack of political vision but it would also be failing in the commitments it has signed up to .

One might well ask what has become of political leadership and vision .
As far as Mr García - Margallo y Marfil &apos; s report is concerned , I would like to note that , according to the Commission , it is an even - handed report which strikes the right balance between an important political vision and the technical measures required in order to make progress .

This , Mr President , is precisely the reason why the European Parliament has wanted not only to discuss , but also to adopt an own - initiative report in order to add fuel to the debate on the next summit , the second of the Heads of State and Government , which will take place next spring , and present a document that could offer a strategic vision with regard to these relations , in order that the European Union will not arrive at this summit empty handed , at least with regard to the responsibility of our institution .

Your vision is controlled by a very delicate system of muscles that move and focus your eyes .
Alcohol slows the function of these muscles and thus impairs vision in several ways .

We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is .
Well , guess what ? People that don &apos;t play a lot of action games , that don &apos;t actually spend a lot of time in front of screens , have normal , or what we call corrective - to - normal vision . That &apos; s okay .

Guess what ? Their vision is really , really good .
I showed that to you already , like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time , those action gamers have a lot of very good vision , etc .

This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up .
So , from the perspective of engineering , we can ask : Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system , can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine - based vision systems that can learn on their own , that don &apos;t need to be programmed by a human programmer ?
He is a man who plays on fear and who has exploited vulnerability .
It is not just children &apos; s human dignity that must be defended , even though their natural vulnerability justifies our affording them major protection .

Among the other issues that have been raised , I would refer in particular to that of the vulnerability of children , to which we must attach enormous importance , cooperating fully not only with UNICEF , but also with specialised NGOs in this field .
The international community should also pay particular attention to the plight of children , some of whom face the real danger of being victims twice if they are not given protection from those ever willing to exploit their vulnerability
The fight against terrorism is fundamentally linked to measures that already help to reduce our society ’ s vulnerability .
It calls upon Member States to use appropriate statutory means to reduce the vulnerability of people making a living from atypical employment .

These facts are forcing us to reduce , and if possible , eliminate our dependency on imported energy and our vulnerability .
Recent problems with energy supply expose our weakness , vulnerability and dependence on third parties .

Following last January ’ s energy crisis , the constant rise in the price of a barrel of crude , amongst other factors , has reopened an in - depth debate on the lack of a common energy policy within the Union , the vulnerability of our supply system , the worrying increase in protectionist attitudes and the need to substantially improve our habits , as well as the efficiency of our consumption .
Nevertheless , Europe ’ s political response to our energy vulnerability is perhaps not yet up to the challenges we are facing .
Furthermore , in view of the complexity of our European society , based on these complex and open networks of communication , supply and services on which , additionally , the economy is founded , we must defend them and defend ourselves in view of their potential vulnerability to terrorist attacks .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this crisis has revealed the vulnerabilities of the European Union in several sensitive areas : firstly , our energy supply .
Three years ago , when we witnessed the first gas crisis following Russia &apos; s cutting of energy supplies , Europe realised its vulnerability and its limitations .
Ukraine must also be made aware that although at the moment it is paying a political price for gas that is lower than the market price , this price is actually costing them more than market price because it extends Ukraine &apos; s vulnerability and susceptibility to blackmail .
In addition , the gas crisis has once again demonstrated our dependency and vulnerability .
Let me also point out that , as illustrated by the Russia - Ukraine gas dispute , the EU &apos; s current vulnerability and considerable energy dependency undermines the development of an authentic , efficient and consistent joint foreign and security policy .
As a small country heavily dependent on energy supplies , we understand very well how expensive this dependence can be both for the end - consumer in terms of price and for the country as a whole in terms of potential political vulnerability .
The Commission has always maintained that piracy can only be finally eradicated by addressing the underlying causes , beginning with the instability in Somalia and also addressing the country &apos; s development needs , which manifest themselves in the most extreme poverty , including massive illiteracy and vulnerability .

This vulnerability has facilitated the rapid spread of disease and the death of more than 1 200 people .
On the other hand , however , we can not forget that , during a period of economic crisis and vulnerability , when unemployment is growing , labour migration policy must be flexible , as argued by the Commission , but also sustainable and reasonable .
The issues we face so far are a consolidation or monopoly of supply and transit , lack of an interconnected single market and particular vulnerability on the Union &apos; s eastern flank .
The real vulnerability of the individual woman exposes her to a greater risk of poverty and social exclusion and therefore of isolation , making it incumbent on the institution that we represent to put in place the specific strategies and programmes mentioned in Mrs Plumb &apos; s report .
However , the disaster also demonstrates the vulnerability of all modern societies .
That is the situation we find ourselves in - in other words , the situation is different in different Member States as regards vulnerability , but we are nevertheless in this together and we need to take a long term - approach to our energy supply .
While the legal migration of labour , and above all qualified labour , helps to fight clandestine working and can improve the competitiveness of the economy and overcome existing shortages , we can not forget that , during a period of economic crisis and vulnerability where unemployment is growing , labour migration policy must be flexible , as argued by the Commission , but must also be sustainable and reasonable .
I therefore agree that surveillance of the economic policies of the Member States should be broadened beyond budgetary surveillance to prevent excessive macroeconomic imbalances and vulnerabilities within the Union .
The Commission &apos; s approach , which focuses on the notions of risk and vulnerability , is highly commendable but , if we are to be sure that account is taken of all the important issues , we need to realize that this is only one side of the coin .
Such is the vulnerability of the system that there is no reliability in the data and I could not dispute much higher figures .
But this small - scale structure also creates vulnerability and disadvantages in a world moving towards globalization .

What makes ours an era of increased vulnerability is the earth ’ s burgeoning population and the greater needs of a crowded world .
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion , and it &apos; s empathy , and it &apos; s passion itself , and it &apos; s vulnerability , and it &apos; s openness , and it &apos; s intensity , and it &apos; s association , and it &apos; s relationship , and it is intuitive .
And then let &apos; s think how compassion informs wisdom , and that vulnerability is our greatest strength , and that emotions have inherent logic , which lead to radical , appropriate , saving action .
I actually realized once in Kosovo , when I watched a man break down , that bullets are actually hardened tears , that when we don &apos;t allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability , and have their compassion , and have their hearts , that they become hardened and hurtful and violent .
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain , at this stage , we move from a time where our economic success , our sense of individual prowess and well - being is directly linked to how much of this we consume , to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability .
Now in the late 1990s , he discovered a vulnerability on all U.S. government networks , and he went in and patched it up -- because this included nuclear research facilities -- sparing the American government a huge security embarrassment .

How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously ?
While most sleep at night , there are always some that are awake , listening and keeping watch .
“ There were ... shepherds living out of doors and keeping watches in the night over their flocks . ” — Luke 2 : 8 .
However , it does say that at the time of Jesus ’ birth , “ there were ... shepherds living out of doors and keeping watches in the night over their flocks . ”
For a thousand years are in your eyes but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch during the night .
In relation to God ’ s spiritual temple and his worship that is carried on there today , the purpose of staying awake and keeping on the watch is the same .
All true Christians , who are the ones favored with having the one and only God - given religion , are responsible to keep on the watch , as long as they are in this Babylonish world .
( a ) Who in congregations of the temple class have a special responsibility to keep on watch ?
Every day they used to remove the ashes from off the Altar at cock - crow , or near to it , either before it or after it ; but on the Day of Atonement &#91; they did so &#93; at midnight , and on the Feast &#91; Passover , Pentecost and Tabernacles &#93; at the first watch .
( b ) Over what is the watch of ministers , so that they should be so careful ?
The watch of ministers is over precious lives or souls .
We will stay awake at our duties and keep within the bounds of our holy commission or assignment of service , just as the priests did who were being ordained for temple service and who were commanded : “ You will stay at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days , and you must keep the obligatory watch of Jehovah , that you may not die . ”
As a reward for staying awake , ever on the watch at the temple against what is unclean and harmful , we have a joyful share in maintaining on earth the true religion , “ the form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father . ”
Even in these last days , when Christians see the gathering together of the great armies of the earth to the battle of Armageddon , they are not fearful , but they stay on the watch , looking after the things that Jehovah God has put in their care .
So right up until the very end , to the finish of the battle of Armageddon , Jehovah ’ s witnesses will continue to be on the watch , staying awake , keeping their ministerial outer garments .
Well - dressed mother with Saks Fifth Avenue &#91; department store &#93; shopping bag stands by car on sidewalk keeping watch .
- ( FR ) Computers , audio and video equipment , toys , fragrances , pharmaceutical products , clocks and watches , cars - absolutely everything is copied .
I can make another comparison : that with a man in an Armani suit and wearing a Rolex watch who is walking around drunk in the middle of the night .
We are all familiar with fake , cheap Rolex watches , Lacoste shirts , with the cheap imitation Levi Strauss jeans , Louis Vuitton bags , and many other products besides .
The same applies to button cells in hearing aids and watches , cordless power tools , emergency lighting and all industrial applications .
Each one of us is probably carrying two or three batteries – in our phones , in our watches , in our car key fobs and maybe there are even one or two heart pacemakers in this Chamber .
– Mr President , the Chinese have a proverb to the effect that one should throw away one ’ s watch before beginning to negotiate .
We live in an age where the volume of counterfeit products is multiplying ; we can see this taking place in the case of clothing items , with Lacoste , in the case of watches , with Rolex , and also , unfortunately , in the case of medicines .
It is one thing to have a watch or designer clothing counterfeited , but it is far more serious if it is a medicine .
The category is broadened to include other locally supplied services of similar nature such as : minor repairs of tangible movable goods , including bikes , shoes , clothes , computers , watches ; cleaning and maintenance services for all these goods ; domestic care services ; all personal care services , including hairdressing , beauty services , gardening services ; renovation and maintenance services provided for places of worship and cultural heritage and historical monuments .
According to my watch , we have just started on the last day of our legislative work .
As you know , on the Internet , you can find thousands of offers for fake goods using European brands , be it for clothes , cosmetics , watches or even foodstuffs .
( NL ) Mr President , I can well imagine that the main purpose of this agreement might be to prevent the counterfeiting of handbags and watches .
We know that when someone sells a counterfeit watch , that is an infringement of intellectual property protection , but when a counterfeit medicine is sold , it is a direct health risk .
We need to remember that it does not matter how many watches we have , but how we spend our time .
